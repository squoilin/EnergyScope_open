# Coach Methane FC

## Intercity Coach Bus Description

The **Intercity Coach Bus** is designed for high-capacity, long-distance
passenger transportation, providing a crucial link between cities with a
focus on comfort and efficiency.

### Intercity Coach Bus Performance Metrics

- **Capacity:** It is equipped to carry 15 or more passengers.
- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** The coach
  operates over an impressive annual distance of 140,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** With an
  average occupancy of 40 passengers per vehicle.
- **Capacity Factor:** Assuming a 20% capacity utilization.
- **Reference Capacity:** Consequently, a reference capacity of
  3,196.35 passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h) is calculated.

The reference capacity is computed using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This calculation takes into account the annual distance covered, the
average number of passengers, and the capacity utilization factor to
provide a clear picture of the Intercity Coach Bus’s performance and
contribution to public transport infrastructure.

## Methane Fuel Cell

Methane fuel cell vehicles leverage the chemical energy of methane, CH4,
to generate electricity through a fuel cell. These vehicles operate on
the principle of converting methane directly into electrical energy,
which then powers the vehicle’s electric motor.
