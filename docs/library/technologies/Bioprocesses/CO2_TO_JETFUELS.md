# CO~2~-To-Jetfuels

## Introduction

The carbon dioxide to jetfuel technology is based on thermochemical
processes to transform CO~2~ and H~2~ to hydrocarbons jetfuels. Carbon
dioxide can be obtained by carbon capture in fossil fuel power plant,
from biogas upgrading to biomethane or also from direct air and seawater
carbon capture. There are approximately 100mg of CO~2~ per liter of
seawater which is 140 times greater than the CO~2~ concentration in air.
Thus, the higher concentration of CO~2~ in liquid water makes it more
beneficial to recover carbon for hydrocarbon production. CO~2~ from
electrochemical carbon capture coupled with hydrogen from a renewable
powered electrolyser unit allow to produce a hydrocarbon gaseous
mixture. Finally, the Fisher-Tropsch process based on a collection of
chemical reactions is used to convert the gaseous mixture into liquid
synthetic hydrocarbons i.e. jetfuel.
