# Decentralized Heat Pump Electricity

## Introduction

This technology refers to a Low Temparature Decentralized Heat Pump system with a
coefficient of performance of 3. Standard heat pumps operate on a
reversed Carnot cycle - instead of harvesting heat from a
high-temperature heat source, generating work and discharging
low-temperature heat into a heat sink as a heat engine does, they
harvest heat from a low-temperature heat source, absorb work and reject
useful heat into a high-temperature heat sink.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the DEC HP Elec are listed in the
table below.
