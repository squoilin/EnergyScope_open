# Electric Train Freight

## Overview

Electric train freight[^1] involves the transportation of goods by trains powered by electric locomotives. This mode of
transportation leverages the efficiency and environmental benefits of electric power, offering a sustainable and
reliable solution for moving large volumes of cargo overland.

## Benefits

- **Environmental Impact**: Electric trains produce zero emissions at the point of use, reducing air pollution and
  greenhouse gas emissions compared to diesel trains.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Electric locomotives are generally more efficient than diesel engines, converting a higher
  percentage of energy into useful work.
- **Reduced Noise**: Electric trains are quieter than diesel-powered trains, reducing noise pollution along rail
  corridors.
- **Operational Cost**: Lower operating costs due to reduced fuel consumption and less maintenance compared to diesel
  engines.

## Applications

- **Bulk Commodities**: Transportation of bulk goods such as coal, grain, minerals, and chemicals.
- **Container Freight**: Movement of intermodal containers, allowing seamless transfer between ships, trucks, and
  trains.

## Challenges

- **Infrastructure Requirements**: Requires extensive and costly electrification infrastructure, including overhead
  lines or third rails and substations.
- **Grid Dependency**: Relies on a stable and robust electricity supply, which can be a challenge in areas with
  unreliable power grids.
- **Initial Investment**: High initial capital costs for electrification projects and electric locomotives.
