# Bus Diesel

## Bus Technology Overview

The **Bus** technology category encompasses city buses designed
specifically for urban transportation.

### Bus Performance and Usage Metrics

The key performance and usage metrics for buses are outlined as follows:

- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** City buses
  have an annual mileage of 56,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** The average
  occupancy rate is 14 passengers per vehicle, as reported by STM.
- **Utilization Factor:** The utilization factor is established at
  35%, resulting of an average speed of 18 (km/h) [^1].
- **Reference Capacity:** This yields a reference capacity of 63.89
  passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h), determined using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.

## Diesel

An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a type of heat engine where fuel
combustion takes place inside a chamber. This causes an increase in
temperature and pressure. This pressure is then applied directly to
pistons, rotors or a nozzle, which converts the thermal energy of
combustion into mechanical energy to move the vehicle. However, this
combustion generates numerous substances with potential impacts on human
health and the environment, including :

- Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~): a GHG contributing to climate change and ocean
  acidification.

- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): precursors to the formation of photochemical
  ozone (smog), which promotes respiratory problems, and causes, among
  other things, the acidification of terrestrial and aquatic
  environments and the eutrophication of the marine environment.

- Particle Matter (PM): potentially causing respiratory problems when
  inhaled.

- Carbon Monoxide (CO): considered toxic to humans and animals.

Diesel engines, which also run on biodiesel and synthetic fuels, do not
require spark plugs but rely on fuel vapour compression to trigger
combustion.

Diesel fuel has an LHV of 11.83 \[kWh/kg\], making it a common choice
for heavy-duty transportation due to its high energy density and
efficiency.
