# Hydrothermal Gasification to CHP

## Introduction

Hydrothermal gasification is a thermochemical process to extract energy
from wet biomass. It converts all organic feedstock such as manure,
sewage sludge and wet forestry without leaving residues. The organic
part is decomposed to synthetic natural gas (SNG) while the inorganic
part can be recovered and used as a fertilizer for agriculture.
Hydrothermal gasification is based on an aqueous system at high
temperatures and pressures. The milled wet biomass is pumped into a
preheater where it is hydrolyzed at temperature around 350
Â°C. A salt separator allows to separate the inorganic
constituents from the organic compounds. Finally, the organic stream is
gasified inside a catalytic reactor and the synthetic natural gas is
obtained by a high pressure separator and a pressure swing adsorption
process removing water and CO~2~. Finally, the obtained SNG can be used to
replace natural gas in a combined heat and power unit.
