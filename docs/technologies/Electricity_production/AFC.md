# Alkaline FC

## Overview

Alkaline Fuel Cells (AFCs) are a type of fuel cell that uses an alkaline electrolyte, typically potassium hydroxide (
KOH), to convert the chemical energy of hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. AFCs are known for their high
efficiency and ability to operate at relatively low temperatures, making them suitable for various applications,
including space missions and stationary power generation.

## Process Description

1. **Hydrogen Supply**: Hydrogen gas (H~2~) is supplied to the anode side of the fuel cell.
2. **Electrochemical Reaction**: The AFC operates at low to moderate temperatures (typically 60-100°C). The alkaline
   electrolyte allows hydroxide ions (OH^-^) to migrate from the cathode to the anode.
    - **At the Anode**: Hydrogen molecules are split into protons and electrons.
        - H~2~ + 2OH^-^ → 2H~2~O + 2e^-^
    - **At the Cathode**: Oxygen molecules react with water and electrons to form hydroxide ions.
        - O~2~ + 2H~2~O + 4e^-^ → 4OH^-^
3. **Electricity Generation**: The movement of electrons through an external circuit generates electricity.
4. **Water Production**: Water is produced as a byproduct at the anode.

## Benefits

- **High Efficiency**: AFCs can achieve high electrical efficiencies, typically around 60% to 70%.
- **Rapid Start-Up**: Capable of starting up quickly, making them suitable for applications requiring immediate power.
- **Operates at Low Temperatures**: Compared to other fuel cells, AFCs operate at lower temperatures, reducing material
  stress and simplifying system design.
- **Proven Technology**: Successfully used in various applications, including NASA's Apollo missions and the Space
  Shuttle program.

## Applications

- **Stationary Power Generation**: Suitable for small to medium-scale power generation applications.
- **Backup Power**: Provides emergency power for critical infrastructure.
- **Portable Power**: Used in portable power units for field operations and remote locations.

## Challenges

- **CO~2~ Sensitivity**: AFCs are sensitive to CO~2~, which can form carbonates in the electrolyte, reducing performance
  and lifespan.
- **Electrolyte Management**: Requires careful management of the alkaline electrolyte to prevent leakage and
  degradation.
- **Material Durability**: The alkaline environment can be corrosive to certain materials, necessitating the use of
  corrosion-resistant components.
- **Fuel Purity**: Requires high-purity hydrogen to avoid contamination and ensure optimal performance.

## Future Outlook

Advancements in materials and electrolyte management are expected to enhance the durability and performance of AFCs.
Efforts to develop CO~2~-resistant electrolyte formulations and improved system designs will address current challenges,
making AFCs more viable for a broader range of applications.
