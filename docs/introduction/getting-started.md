Welcome to the EnergyScope library! This guide will help you set up and start using EnergyScope, whether you‚Äôre a beginner looking to run simulations or an expert aiming to modify the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

1. **Install AMPL**

    - EnergyScope relies on AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) for optimization modeling. AMPL must be installed first and be accessible from your system‚Äôs PATH.
    - See the [Installing AMPL section](#installing-ampl) below for detailed instructions.

2. **Install Python**

    - Version: Python 3.6 or higher.
    - Environment: We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Choose Your Path

### Option A: Quick Start for Beginners üòé

If you‚Äôre new to EnergyScope and want a quick setup without delving into the source code:

1. **Install EnergyScope via `pip`**:

    ```bash
    pip install energyscope
    ```

2. **Run the Basic Tutorial**:

    Get started by following our [Basic Run Tutorial](../tutorials/basic-run.ipynb) to familiarize yourself with EnergyScope.

### Option B: Editable Installation for Experts üèÑ

If you plan to customize the source code or the underlying AMPL models:

1. **Clone the EnergyScope Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/energyscope/energyscope.git
    ```

2. **Install EnergyScope in Editable Mode**:

    Navigate to the cloned repository and install the package in editable mode:

    ```bash
    cd energyscope
    pip install -e .
    ```

    Alternatively, if you‚Äôre working within a Jupyter notebook or an interactive environment, you can use:

    ```python
    # Clone the repository
    !git clone git@gitlab.com:energyscope/energyscope.git

    # Install the package in editable mode
    %pip install -e ./energyscope

    # Add the package to the Python path (if necessary)
    import sys
    sys.path.append('./energyscope')
    ```

3. **Modify and Run Code**:

    You‚Äôre now ready to explore and modify the source code and AMPL models according to your needs.

## Installing AMPL

EnergyScope uses AMPL for optimization modeling. Follow these steps to install AMPL on your system:

1. **Download AMPL**

    - Visit the [AMPL Community Edition](https://ampl.com/ce/) page to download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Install AMPL**

    - **Windows**:
    
        - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
    
    - **Linux and macOS**:
    
        - Extract the downloaded archive to a directory where you have read and write permissions (e.g., your home directory).

3. **Activate Your License**

    - AMPL Community Edition requires a free license.
    - During installation, you‚Äôll receive a license UUID.
    - Activate your license by running the following command in the AMPL command prompt:

        ```bash
        shell "amplkey activate --uuid <license-uuid>";
        ```

      Replace `<license-uuid>` with your actual license UUID.

    !!! warning 
        Restart AMPL after activation to start using the new license.

4. **Add AMPL to PATH**

    - **Windows**:
    
        - Add the AMPL installation directory (e.g., `C:\AMPL`) to your system‚Äôs PATH environment variable.
    
    - **Linux and macOS**:
    
        - Open your terminal and add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:

        ```bash
        export PATH="/path/to/ampl:$PATH"
        ```

      Replace `/path/to/ampl` with the actual path to your AMPL directory.

5. **Verify AMPL Installation**

    To confirm that AMPL is correctly installed:

    - Open Command Prompt or Terminal:
    
        - Open a new command prompt (Windows) or terminal window (Linux/macOS).
    
    - Run AMPL:

        ```bash
        ampl
        ```

    - If installed correctly, you should see the `ampl:` prompt. You can quit with the command:

        ```
        quit;
        ```

## Running EnergyScope

With both EnergyScope and AMPL installed, you‚Äôre ready to run simulations. Browse through the tutorials to learn how to get started with the code in this project.

- **Basic Run:**
  
    - Start with the [Basic Run Tutorial](../tutorials/basic-run.ipynb) to learn how to set up and execute a basic energy model.

- **Change Model:**
  
    - Proceed with the [Change Model](../tutorials/choose-datasets.ipynb) to learn how to switch between different models and datasets.

- **Multiple Runs:**
  
    - Once the models selected, you can run multiple times with the [Mutliple Runs Tutorial](../tutorials/multiple-runs.ipynb) to learn how to make a parametrization.

- **and many more...**
