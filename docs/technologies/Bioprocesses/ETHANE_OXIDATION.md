# Ethane Oxidation to Acetic Acid

## Introduction

Ethane oxidation is a thermochemical process to produce acetic acid via
selective oxidation of ethane. Acetic acid is an important industrial
product with world-wide production. The direct oxidation of ethane to
acetic acid can be an alternative to methanol carbonylation process
because of the cheap feedstock of ethane being a component of natural
gas. Ethane and oxygen streams are mixed with water steam, compressed
and pre-heated up to the reaction conditions of 515 K, 16 bar. Formed
gas and liquid mixture is divided in a flash. The gaseous stream
consists of non-reacted ethane, ethylene and CO~2~. The acetic acid water
mixture is separated as bottom product and is purified by removing the
water content.
