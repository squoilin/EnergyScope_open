# Wood Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch to Diesel

## Introduction

The Wood Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch to Diesel process is a serie
of thermochemical reactions to create a bioliquid fuel from wood.
Gasification converts a carbonaceous solid into a producer gas (wood gas
in the case of wood feedstock) thanks to a gasification agent. The
producer gas is a mixture of H~2~, CO, CO~2~ and N~2~ while the gasification
agent can be air, steam or oxygen. There are different configurations of
gasification technologies such as fluidized bed, entrained flow
or fixed bed. Based on the configuration, the obtained mixture and the
level of impurities will be different. The synthetic gas is then
converted to biodiesel thanks to Fischer-Tropsch chemical reactions
converting the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to liquid
hydrocarbons. Finally, Diesel is separated from other hydrocarbons by
product fractionation.
