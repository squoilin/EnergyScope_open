# EOR

## Introduction

Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) or tertiary recovery, is the method used to
extract crude oil when primary and secondary recovery have already been
used in an oil field. EOR with CO~2~ is based on the injection of CO~2~ into
deep reservoir to increase oil production. CO~2~ reduces the viscosity of
oil allowing to flow more easily toward the production well. During this
process the CO~2~ becomes trapped in the rock and is permanently stored in
the porous spaces.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the EOR are listed in the table below.
