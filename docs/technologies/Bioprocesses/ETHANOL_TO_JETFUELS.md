# Ethanol to Jetfuels

## Introduction

Ethanol to Jetfuel are biochemical processes to convert ethanol to
hydrocarbons for transport applications. Ethanol is dehydrated
catalytically to ethylene that is pressurized before entering the
oligomerization reactor. The resulting olefins are fractionated to light
hydrocarbons in car gasoline, diesel and jet-range fuels by product
fractionation.
