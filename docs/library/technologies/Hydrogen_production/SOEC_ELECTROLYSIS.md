# SOEC Electrolysis

## Introduction

Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) Technology is a solid oxide fuel
cell that runs in reverse mode to achieve electrolysis of water to
produce hydrogen and oxygen. SOEC is different from Alkaline and PEM
electrolysis as it operates at high temperature and uses steam instead
of water. Due to a high efficiency, SOEC has a low electricity demand.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the SOEC Electrolysis are listed in the
table below.
