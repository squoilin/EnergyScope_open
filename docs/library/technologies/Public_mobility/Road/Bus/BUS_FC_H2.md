# Bus Hydrogen FC

## Bus Technology Overview

The **Bus** technology category encompasses city buses designed
specifically for urban transportation.

### Bus Performance and Usage Metrics

The key performance and usage metrics for buses are outlined as follows:

- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** City buses
  have an annual mileage of 56,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** The average
  occupancy rate is 14 passengers per vehicle, as reported by STM.
- **Utilization Factor:** The utilization factor is established at
  35%, resulting of an average speed of 18 (km/h) [^1].
- **Reference Capacity:** This yields a reference capacity of 63.89
  passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h), determined using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.

## Hydrogen Fuel Cell

A hydrogen fuel cell operates by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms to
form water, releasing energy in the process. This energy can be
converted into electricity and heat. One type of hydrogen fuel cell,
known as a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) cell, uses a solid polymer
membrane that allows protons to pass through, while blocking electrons.
The membrane is coated with catalysts to accelerate the reaction.
Hydrogen molecules are fed to the anode, where they dissociate into
protons and electrons. The protons pass through the membrane to the
cathode, while the electrons circulate in an external circuit,
generating a voltage. At the cathode, oxygen molecules react with
protons and electrons to form water vapor, which is released from the
fuel cell. Overall, the operation of a hydrogen fuel cell relies on the
chemical affinity between hydrogen and oxygen, with the PEM cells being
one specific type of fuel cell.
