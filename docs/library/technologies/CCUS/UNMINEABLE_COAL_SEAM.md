# Unmineable Coal Seam

## Introduction

Coal seams are a possible location for permanent geological storage of
CO~2~. These so-called Unmineable Coal Seamable coal seams are either too
thin, too deep or too high in sulfur content and mineral matter (White
et al., 2005). Coal seams presenting economically profitable mining are
the one considered.
