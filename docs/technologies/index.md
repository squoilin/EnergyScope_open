This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of all technologies included in the EnergyScope model, categorized by their function within the energy system. Each technology group addresses a distinct component of the energy system, with individual markdown files documenting the specific characteristics, parameters, and references for each technology.

## Technology Categories

EnergyScope organizes technologies into the following categories:

1. **Bioprocesses**: Technologies related to the conversion of biological materials into energy, fuels, or other useful products.
   
2. **Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)**: Technologies designed to capture carbon emissions from various processes and either store or utilize them for other purposes.
   
3. **Centralized Heat**: Large-scale technologies for the production and distribution of heat, often through district heating systems.

4. **Chemical Storage**: Technologies that store energy in chemical forms, such as hydrogen or batteries, for later use.
   
5. **Decentralized Heat**: Smaller-scale heat production systems used in individual buildings or local setups, often focused on residential or commercial applications.

6. **Electricity Production**: Technologies that generate electricity from various sources, including renewable energy, nuclear, and fossil fuels.

7. **Electricity Storage**: Technologies used to store electricity, enabling balancing between supply and demand, and improving grid flexibility.

8. **Freight Mobility**: Technologies related to the transportation of goods, including electric, hydrogen, and other alternative-fuel freight vehicles.

9. **Hydrogen Production**: Technologies that produce hydrogen as an energy carrier, either through electrolysis or other processes, to be used in energy storage, industry, or transportation.

10. **Industrial Heat**: Technologies that provide heat for industrial processes, which often require high temperatures and can involve significant energy consumption.

11. **Infrastructure Grid**: Technologies related to the transmission and distribution infrastructure for electricity, heat, and other energy carriers.

12. **Private Mobility**: Technologies for personal transportation, including electric vehicles, biofuel-powered vehicles, and other forms of individual mobility.

13. **Public Mobility**: Technologies related to mass transit systems, including electric and hydrogen buses, trains, and other public transport solutions.

## Technology Parameters

Each technology within these categories is characterized by a set of parameters, documented in the corresponding markdown files:

- **Capacity**: Installed or potential capacity of the technology.
- **Efficiency**: Conversion efficiency, either for energy generation, storage, or consumption.
- **Capital Cost**: The initial investment cost required to install the technology.
- **Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Costs**: Ongoing costs associated with operating and maintaining the technology.
- **Lifetime**: The expected operational lifespan of the technology.
- **Emissions**: Any emissions associated with the technology's operation, including COâ‚‚ and other pollutants.
- **Other Parameters**: Technology-specific details such as ramp-up times, fuel consumption, and availability factors.

Each parameter is backed by specific references to ensure accuracy and transparency. These references are provided at the end of each technology's documentation.
