# DOGR

## Introduction

Depleted oil and gas reservoirs (DOGR) are candidates for underground carbon
storage. DOGR are considered very appealing for carbon sequestration due
to economic factor. Indeed, the underground and surface infrastructure
such as wells and pipelines are already available and can be used for
CO~2~ storage with small modifications. The objective is to sequestrate
carbon beneath caprock into porous rock.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the DOGR are listed in the table below.
