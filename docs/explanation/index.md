# Overview

This section explains how the EnergyScope model is structured. 

The [Background](./background.md) page provides conceptual foundations about optimization model formulations and the key choices behind the development of EnergyScope. 

The [Documentation (core version)](./background.md) section provides a detailed explanation of the formulation of the EnergyScope "core" version used in the [Getting Started](../getting-started/index.md) page. While many versions of EnergyScope exists, the core version is a great place to start with. Links to the documentation for other versions of EnergyScope are provided in the corresponding [Model Versions](../models/index.md) page.
