# CO~2~-To-Diesel

## Introduction

The carbon dioxide to diesel technology is a collection of
thermochemical processes to transform captured CO~2~ and green H~2~ to a
mixture of hydrocarbons: diesel and car gasoline. Carbon dioxide can be
obtained by carbon capture in fossil fuel power plant, from biogas
upgrading to biomethane with amine scrubbing or also from direct air and
seawater carbon capture. The parameters of this technology are based on
a carbon capture plant from biogas upgrading. The CO~2~ is sent to a
reverse water gas shift reactor (RWGS) with green hydrogen deriving from
a pressure swing adsorption unit. The product of this process is a
synthetic gas combining CO and H~2~. The syngas is then transformed to
hydrocarbons liquid thanks to the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis. The
product distribution of the FT reactions is primarily driven by the
choice of operating temperature. At high temperature, it results in Car
Gasoline to diesel ratio of 2:1 and at low temperature, it results in
car gasoline to diesel ratio of 1:2.
