# Ethane to Ethylene

## Introduction

Ethane (C~2~H~6~) to Ethylene
(C~2~H~4~) is a process to transform ethane to
ethylene thanks to a serie of thermochemical processes such as ethane
steam cracking. Ethane hydrocarbon feed is mixed with superheated steam
and sent into a cracking furnace where the feedstock is briefly heated
to very high temperature. Hydrocarbons are broken down to smaller and
lighter olefins including ethylene and propylene. The furnace outlet
stream is subsequently fed to a water-based quench, to prevent further
reactions.The stream goes to a serie of separation column to remove
byproducts such as methane. Then, a separation column called C~2~-splitter
allows to recover high purity ethylene. Ethylene is the most commonly
manufactured petrochemical as it is the root chemical for
plastics and synthetic products.
