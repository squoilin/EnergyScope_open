# LCV Gasoline

## Light Commercial Vehicle Class Overview

The **Light Commercial Vehicle** class encompasses four-wheeled,
two-axle vehicles, primarily designed for goods transportation. These
vehicles are notable for their adaptability to a range of cargo needs,
demonstrating versatility in the light-duty commercial sector.

### Light Commercial Vehicle Performance Metrics

- **Operational Distance (*d~annual~*):** On an
  annual basis, these vehicles are capable of covering a distance of
  38,600 km.
- **Average Cargo Weight (*n~lpv~*):** They support an
  average cargo weight of 0.19 tonnes per vehicle, accommodating the
  transportation needs of various goods.
- **Capacity Factor:** A 10% capacity utilization factor is applied to
  account for frequent stops and loading times, which are
  characteristic of their operational environment.
- **Reference Efficiency:** This results in a reference efficiency of
  8.37 tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h), underlining their essential
  role in fulfilling light-duty commercial transportation tasks.

The reference efficiency is calculated as follows:

$$
ref_{efficiency} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This formula reflects the annual operational distance, the average cargo
weight, and the capacity utilization factor, offering a clear
perspective on the efficiency and utility of Light Commercial Vehicles
in commercial transportation.

## Gasoline

An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a type of heat engine where fuel
combustion takes place inside a chamber. This causes an increase in
temperature and pressure. This pressure is then applied directly to
pistons, rotors or a nozzle, which converts the thermal energy of
combustion into mechanical energy to move the vehicle. However, this
combustion generates numerous substances with potential impacts on human
health and the environment, including : - Carbon dioxide (CO2): a GHG
contributing to climate change and ocean acidification. - Nitrogen
oxides (NOx): precursors to the formation of photochemical ozone (smog),
which promotes respiratory problems, and causes, among other things, the
acidification of terrestrial and aquatic environments and the
eutrophication of the marine environment. - Fine particles (PM):
potentially causing respiratory problems when inhaled. - Carbon monoxide
(CO): considered toxic to humans and animals.

All gasoline engines use spark plugs to ignite the air-fuel mixture.
Although these engines are commonly referred to as “gasoline engines”,
they can also run on propane, methanol, ethanol, natural gas or
hydrogen.
