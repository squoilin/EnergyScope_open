# Decentralized Direct Electric Heating

## Introduction

Direct electric heating refers to resistance heaters with fan assisted
air circulation with a electric to thermal efficiency of 1. However, it
is important to focus on the complete chain from the primary energy to
the final one, considering all conversion devices in-between. For
instance, if this electricity has been produced with a CCGT the
efficiency will drop to 60%.
