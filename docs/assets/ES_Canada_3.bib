  abstract = {Abstract                            Purpose               As wind power generation increases globally, there will be a substantial number of wind turbines that need to be decommissioned in the coming years. It is crucial for wind farm developers to design safe and cost-effective decommissioning plans and procedures for assets before they reach the end of their useful life. Adequate financial provisions for decommissioning operations are essential, not only for wind farm owners but also for national governments. Economic analysis approaches and cost estimation models therefore need to be accurate and computationally efficient. Thus, this paper aims to develop an economic assessment framework for decommissioning of offshore wind farms using a cost breakdown structure (CBS) approach.                                         Methods               In the development of the models, all the cost elements and their key influencing factors are identified from literature and expert interviews. Similar activities within the decommissioning process are aggregated to form four cost groups including: planning and regulatory approval, execution, logistics and waste management, and post-decommissioning. Some mathematical models are proposed to estimate the costs associated with decommissioning activities as well as to identify the most critical cost drivers in each activity group. The proposed models incorporate all cost parameters involved in each decommissioning phase for more robust cost assessment.                                         Results and discussion               A case study of a 500~MW baseline offshore wind farm is proposed to illustrate the models' applicability. The results show that the removal of wind turbines and foundation structures is the most costly and lengthy stage of the decommissioning process due to many requirements involved in carrying out the operations. Although inherent uncertainties are taken into account, cost estimates can be easily updated when new information becomes available. Additionally, further decommissioning cost elements can be captured allowing for sensitivity analysis to be easily performed.                                         Conclusions               Using the CBS approach, cost drivers can be clearly identified, revealing critical areas that require attention for each unique offshore wind decommissioning project. The CBS approach promotes adequate management and optimisation of identified key cost drivers, which will enable all stakeholders involved in offshore wind farm decommissioning projects to achieve cost reduction and optimal schedule, especially for safety-critical tasks.},

  abstract = {Different Li-ion battery technologies and sizes are used in battery electric buses (BEBs), but little is known about the environmental effect of various battery technology and sizing alternatives. In a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of seven BEBs, we consider three battery technologies combined with relevant pack sizes to evaluate the size and range effect. The environmental performance of the BEBs was assessed over the typical length of a bus tender of 10 years as well as an extended lifetime of 20 years. Across six environmental impact categories we found that the size and range effect depends to a large extent on the performance of the battery technology and that a smaller battery size of the same technology is not necessarily environmentally preferable. Furthermore, extending the BEB lifetime from 10 to 20 years changes the environmental per\- formance as well as relative contributions to environmental impact potentials for the various BEB alternatives.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Process-based Life Cycle Assessments (PLCA) rely on detailed descriptions of extensive value chains and their associated exchanges with the environment, but major data gaps limit the completeness of these system descriptions and lead to truncations in inventories and underestimations of impacts. Hybrid Life Cycle Assessments (HLCA) aim to combine the strength of PLCA and Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) analysis to obtain more specific and complete system descriptions. Currently, however, most HLCAs only remediate truncation of processes that are specific to each case study (foreground processes), and these processes are then linked to (truncated) generic background processes from a non-hybridized PLCA database. A hybrid PLCA-EEIO database is therefore required to completely solve the truncation problems of PLCA and thus obtain a comprehensive product system coverage. This paper describes the construction of such a database using pyLCAIO, a novel framework and open-source software enabling the streamlined hybridization of entire PLCA and EEIO databases. We applied this framework to the PLCA database Ecoinvent3.5 and the multiregional EEIO database EXIOBASE~3. Thanks to the correction for truncation in this new hybrid database, the median and average life cycle global warming potential (GWP) of its processes increased by 7\% and 14\%, respectively. These corrections only reflect the truncations that could be readily identified and estimated in a semi-automated manner; and we anticipate that further database integration should lead to higher levels of correction in the future.},

This case study aims at elucidating how process system engineering tools such as thermal process integration, life cycle analysis, economic evaluation and multi-objective optimization can contribute to minimizing some future challenges of the industrial implementation of supercritical fluid-based technologies, which were discussed in the Workshop on Supercritical Fluids and Energy -- SFE'13. In addition, this case study exposes future perspectives in terms of the requirements to further develop this field. The optimized solutions of the evaluated case showed that the SCWG process increases the overall efficiency of the process in terms of energy and carbon fixation. It decreases the CO2 equivalent emissions and it leads to a thermally self-sufficient process. The economic analysis showed a high investment cost but a feasibility of using the current market prices for the produced fuels and electricity.},

  abstract = {World estimated municipal solid waste generating at an alarming rate and its disposal is a severe concern of today's world. It is equivalent to 0.79~kg/d per person footprint and causing climate change; health hazards and other environmental issues which need attention on an urgent basis. Waste to energy (WTE) considers as an alternative renewable energy potential to recover energy from waste and reduce the global waste problems. WTE reduced the burden on fossil fuels for energy generation, waste volumes, environmental, and greenhouse gases emissions. This critical review aims to evaluate the source of solid waste generation and the possible routes of waste management such as biological landfill and thermal treatment (Incineration, pyrolysis, and gasification). Moreover, a comparative evaluation of different technologies was reviewed in terms of economic and environmental aspects along with their limitations and advantages. Critical literature revealed that gasification seemed to be the efficient route and environmentally sustainable. In addition, a framework for the gasification process, gasifier types, and selection of gasifiers for MSW was presented. The country-wise solutions recommendation was proposed for solid waste management with the least impact on the environment. Furthermore, key issues and potential perspectives that require urgent attention to facilitate global penetration are highlighted. Finally, practical implications of membrane and comparison membrane-based separation technology with other conventional technologies to recover bioenergy and resources were discussed. It is expected that this study will lead towards practical solution for future advancement in terms of economic and environmental concerns, and also provide economic feasibility and practical implications for global penetration.},

Im Energiesystem werden Energie und/oder Energietr{\"a}ger r{\"a}umlich von Energieversorgungsnetzen verteilt, w{\"a}hrend die bedarfsgerechte Bereitstellung gegenw{\"a}rtig daf{\"u}r sorgt, dass der Energiebedarf zu jeder Zeit gedeckt wird. Energie aus erneuerbaren Quellen wird in der Regel nicht bedarfsgerecht bereitgestellt; ihr Anteil steigt. Energiespeicher sind eine M{\"o}glichkeit, das zeitlich versetzte Angebot mit der Nachfrage zur Deckung zu bringen. Energiespeicher sind Systeme, die eine Energiemenge kontrolliert aufnehmen, sie {\"u}ber einen im Kontext relevanten Zeitraum in einem Speichermedium zur{\"u}ckhalten und mit zeitlicher Verz{\"o}gerung wieder kontrolliert abgeben k{\"o}nnen. Zu den Energiespeichern geh{\"o}ren nach dieser Definition auch Verfahrensketten, die diese Aspekte durch eine Kombination verschiedener Technologien abbilden. Als mechanische Gro{\ss}speicher f{\"u}r elektrischen Strom dienen heute fast ausschlie{\ss}lich Pumpwasserspeicherkraftwerke, die zuk{\"u}nftig durch Druckluftspeicherkraftwerke und eventuell Luftzerlegungsanlagen erg{\"a}nzt werden k{\"o}nnten. Im Bereich der elektrochemischen Energiespeicher befinden sich verschiedene Technologien im Forschungs-, Entwicklungs- und/oder Demonstrationsstadium f{\"u}r einen Einsatz in der station{\"a}ren gro{\ss}technischen Stromspeicherung. Thermische Speichertechnologien beruhen auf der Speicherung von sensibler W{\"a}rme, der Ausnutzung von Phasen{\"u}berg{\"a}ngen, Adsorption-/Desorptionsprozessen oder chemischen Reaktionen, die prinzipiell eine dauerhafte und verlustfreie Speicherung von W{\"a}rme erm{\"o}glichen k{\"o}nnen. Die Speicherung von Energie in Form chemischer Bindungen in stofflichen Speichern verl{\"a}uft {\"u}ber Substanzen, die selbst als Energietr{\"a}ger oder Chemikalien verwendet werden k{\"o}nnen; sie befinden sich damit in direkter Konkurrenz zu alternativen Bereitstellungs- und Nutzungsvarianten. Die Schl{\"u}sseltechnologie hierbei ist auf absehbare Zeit die Elektrolyse von Wasser zu Wasserstoff und Sauerstoff. Wasserstoff kann wiederum durch verschiedene Verfahren in andere Energietr{\"a}ger umgewandelt werden. So l{\"a}sst er sich in verschiedenen Sektoren des Energiesystems und/oder in energieintensiven Industrieprozessen stofflich nutzen. Teilfunktionen von Energiespeichern k{\"o}nnen auch von Industrieprozessen wahrgenommen werden. Dem Energiesystem in seiner Gesamtheit er{\"o}ffnen sich neue Optionen, die bisher weitgehend getrennten Energieversorgungsstr{\"o}me zu verkn{\"u}pfen und zu vernetzen. Neben der M{\"o}glichkeit, verst{\"a}rkt erneuerbare Energien au{\ss}erhalb des Stromsektors zu nutzen, ergeben sich auch neue Bedingungen f{\"u}r eine verst{\"a}rkte Flexibilisierung, neuartige Synergieeffekte und zus{\"a}tzliche Optimierungsm{\"o}glichkeiten. Anhand verschiedener Referenzf{\"a}lle wird der m{\"o}gliche Einsatz von Speichertechnologien aufgezeigt und bewertet.},

  abstract = {The chemical industry is an essential part of the modern societies we live in. By turning resources into valuable products and materials that enable many downstream value chains, the chemical industry delivers strong benefits and provides solutions to the grand societal challenges that the world needs to address in the 21st century. The impact of CO2 emissions is one of the most difficult challenges to be addressed. Virtually all human activities require energy and products that currently rely heavily on cheap and abundant fossil resources. The chemical industry is no exception. It requires energy for running its processes, and feedstock - most often carbon feedstock, eventually embedded in most chemical products and materials - resulting in CO2 emissions. However, the European chemical industry has a solid track record in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its industrial operations. In addition, it delivers solutions to achieve major energy-savings in many value chains (e.g. construction with insulation materials, transportation with fuel-saving technologies and lightweight materials), with benefits in terms of CO2 emission reductions. The scope of this study is to analyse how the chemical industry could use breakthrough technologies to further reduce CO2 emissions resulting from the production of its key building blocks. The purpose of this study is to provide quantitative data on promising low carbon technologies, estimate their potential impact on CO2 emission reductions, and highlight the current technological and financial limitations and barriers. Promising technologies are available at a relatively advanced stage of development, however their implementation on a wide scale is hard to achieve under the current framework conditions, while we also need to safeguard the benefits and the global competitiveness of this key industrial sector in Europe. This shows the need for a concerted approach between public and private stakeholders to further support an ambitious research and innovation agenda, with a strong focus on industrial relevance. It also shows the need, more than ever, for a close dialogue between public and private stakeholders about the regulatory framework that will allow the shift in the long run. The study is a valuable input into the discussion on the future of the European chemical industry and the transition towards a carbon neutral society. Its key findings will hopefully foster a successful dialogue amongst key stakeholders.},

  abstract = {With the increasing strength and frequency of climate change events, the urgency to mitigate climate change impact is ever so important. Canada reported his Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) and submitted its ambition to reduce his Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 40-45\% by 2030 compared to 2005 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Interest for energy system modelling has been increasing for planning future energy systems, as a result of growing concern for sustainable development and transition towards renewable energies. Nevertheless, planning a decarbonization of energy system can potentially lead to environmental burden shifting, and can increase impacts on other environmental impacts such as ecosystem quality or human health. Thus, this project aims towards integrating Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and more specifically Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) within Energy Systems Modelling, in order to minimize not only climate change impacts, but human health and ecosystem quality. In addition, a dual spatial resolution was integrated in the model in order to increase data precision and computational efficiency. The results show that a low-carbon energy system, based on the optimization of GHG emissions allows to greatly reduce all the environmental impacts under analysis, compared to an all economic- based energy system, but a multi-objective optimization allows to simultaneously reduce impacts on ecosystem quality and human health, while reducing GHG emissions and keeping good economical and technical performances. The results also show that it is theoretically possible for Canada to keep on track with their emission reduction ambition by 2030, by deploying more renewable energies. This project does not allow assessing Canada's potential to reach net-zero emissions, as environmental impacts from carbon capture technologies are still to be characterized and integrated in the model},

  abstract = {The recent geopolitical conflicts in Europe have underscored the vulnerability of the current energy system to the volatility of energy carrier prices. In the prospect of defining robust energy systems ensuring sustainable energy supply in the future, the imperative of leveraging renewable indigenous energy sources becomes evident. However, as such technologies are integrated into the existing system, it is necessary to shift from the current centralized infrastructure to a decentralized production strategy. This paper presents a method to identify a panel of technological solutions at the district level, intended to reduce complexity for the integration of decentralized models into a national-scale model. The framework's novelty lies in combining a global sensitivity analysis for solution generation with clustering to identify typical configurations. The global sensitivity analysis is performed on a mixed integer linear programming model, which optimally sizes and operates district energy systems. The sensitivity analysis determines the most influential parameters of the model using the Morris method and provides a representative sampling of the solution space by leveraging the Sobol sampling strategy. The latter is then clustered using a density-based algorithm to identify typical solutions. The framework is applied to a suburban and residential Swiss neighborhood. The first outcome of the research is the high sensitivity of the model to energy carrier prices. As a result, Sobol's sampling space separates itself into two system types: those based on a natural gas boiler and those relying on a combination of electrical heaters and heat pumps. For both types, the electricity demand is either fulfilled by PV panels or electricity imports. The identified configurations showcase that the framework successfully generates a panel of solutions composed of various system configurations and operations being representative of the overall solution space.},

  abstract = {A large number of countries have engaged themselves in an energy transition towards more re- newable energy in their energy systems. Motivations stem mainly from the need to reduce CO2 emissions, and from a desire of their population to phase out technologies such as nuclear. Most of these countries promote biomass, wind and solar energy sources, among other possibilities. How- ever the current rate of deployment of renewable energy systems globally is not sufficient to reach the CO2 emissions reduction that would allow to maintain the global average temperature increase below the 2{$^\circ$}C threshold. The main barriers to a wider integration of renewable energy systems are i) their limited realisable potential, ii) their still limited competitiveness, iii) their intermittence; iv) public acceptance often related to poor level of energy literacy amongst citizens. Citizens are key decision-makers. They must decide on energy policies and on the energy technologies they use, hence they have the power to foster or halt the energy transition. This thesis presents two different strategies for addressing the problem of the integration of re- newable energy sources for energy transitions. The first one (Chapter 1) consists in developing an energy modelling tool to help decision-makers understand the energy system and find their own answers. The modelling approach also includes a new methodology for the calculation of the total cost of a national energy system. A model of the Swiss energy system has been created following this approach, which serves as basis to develop the Swiss-Energyscope online calculator. This calculator and its model present an optimal trade-off between scientific rigour and user-friendliness, which allows the reproduction of the energy transition scenarios conceived by the Swiss Government, and consequently its use for energy policy making. The second strategy (chapters 2 and 3) profits from the possibilities offered by mathematical mod- elling and optimisation to analyse national energy systems, and derive insights for policy and decision-makers. First, a methodology using a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) model analyses biomass usage pathways to determine its optimal use in Switzeland in 2035. Second, in order to study the role of biomass, non-linear optimisation is applied to create future scenarios. (Chapter 3) focuses on the solutions to deal with the variability of renewable electricity. To this end, a MILP model with hourly time resolution is conceived to study the use of flexible electricity supply and demand options for the integration of renewable electricity. The optimisation methodologies are validated on case studies for the Swiss energy system. Regarding biomass, the results reveal that woody biomass chemical conversion technologies can allow for an overall better performance in terms of CO2 avoided emissions compared to direct combustion, as long as the produced biofuels are used in efficient technologies. Results also show that the combination of the gasification-methanation process of woody biomass with the production of H2 produced from excess electricity would allow to reduce the Swiss natural gas imports to zero by 2050. Concerning the integration of variable renewable electricity, the cost difference between using flexible electricity supply- and demand-options or electricity imports to deal with variable renewable electricity is below 2.5\% of the total cost of the energy system},

  abstract = {Concerns related to climate change and security of energy supply are pushing various countries to make strategic energy planning decisions. This requires the development of energy models to aid decision-making. Large scale energy models are often very complex and use economic optimization to define energy strategies. Thus, they might be black-boxes to public decision-makers. This work aims at overcoming this issue by proposing a new modelling framework, designed to support decision-makers by improving their understanding of the energy system. The goal is to show the effect of the policy and investment decisions on final energy consumption, total cost and environmental impact. The modelling approach and the model structure are described in detail. Final energy consumption is represented as the sum of three main components: heating, electricity and transportation. In this framework, a sequential modelling strategy allows the assessment of the competition between electricity and fuels in the heating and transportation sectors without increasing the model complexity. A monthly resolution is chosen in order to highlight seasonality issues of the energy system. Developed with the goal of being easily adaptable to any large-scale energy system, the modelling approach is currently implemented within an online energy calculator for the case of Switzerland.},

Using ESOMs to produce policy-relevant insight requires significant modeler judgement, yet little formal guidance exists on how to conduct analysis with ESOMs. To address this shortcoming, we draw on our collective modelling experience and conduct an extensive literature review to formalize best practice for energy system optimization modelling. We begin by articulating a set of overarching principles that can be used to guide ESOM-based analysis. To help operationalize the guiding principles, we outline and explain critical steps in the modelling process, including how to formulate research questions, set spatio-temporal boundaries, consider appropriate model features, conduct and refine the analysis, quantify uncertainty, and communicate insights. We highlight the need to develop and refine formal guidance on ESOM application, which comes at a critical time as ESOMs are being used to inform national climate targets.},

  abstract = {This study compares the short-term economic feasibility of six conversion pathways for renewable jet fuel (RJF) production. The assessment combines (i) a harmonized techno-economic analysis of conversion pathways expected to be certified for use in commercial aviation by 2020, (ii) a pioneer plant analysis taking into account technological immaturity, and (iii) a quantified assessment of the merits of co-producing RJF alongside existing European supply chains in the pulp, wheat ethanol, and beet sugar industries. None of the pathways assessed are able to reach price parity with petroleum-derived jet fuel in the short term. The pioneer plant analysis suggests that the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway is currently the best option; the technology achieves the lowest minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 29.3 {\texteuro} GJ-1 (1289 {\texteuro} t-1) and the technology is deployed on commercial scale already. In the short term, nth plant analysis shows hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis emerging as promising alternatives, yielding MFSPs of 21.4 {\texteuro} GJ-1 (939 {\texteuro} t-1) and 30.2 {\texteuro} GJ-1 (1326 {\texteuro} t-1), respectively. The pioneer plant analysis shows considerable MFSP increases for producing drop-in fuels using HTL and pyrolysis as both technologies are relatively immature. Hence, further RD\&amp;D efforts into these pathways are recommended. Co-production strategies decrease the MFSP by 4-8\% compared to greenfield production. Integration of process units and material and energy flows is expected to lead to further cost reductions. As such, co-production can be a particularly useful strategy to progress emerging technologies to commercial scale. {\copyright} 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Utilising CO2 as a feedstock for chemicals and fuels could help mitigate climate change and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. For this reason, there is an increasing world-wide interest in carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). As part of a broader project to identify key technical advances required for sustainable CCU, this work considers different process designs, each at a high level of technology readiness and suitable for large-scale conversion of CO2 into liquid hydrocarbon fuels, using biogas from sewage sludge as a source of CO2. The main objective of the paper is to estimate fuel production yields and costs of different CCU process configurations in order to establish whether the production of hydrocarbon fuels from commercially proven technologies is economically viable. Four process concepts are examined, developed and modelled using the process simulation software Aspen Pluss to determine raw materials, energy and utility requirements. Three design cases are based on typical biogas applications: (1) biogas upgrading using a monoethanolamine (MEA) unit to remove CO2, (2) combustion of raw biogas in a combined heat and power (CHP) plant and (3) combustion of upgraded biogas in a CHP plant which represents a combination of the first two options. The fourth case examines a post-combustion CO2 capture and utilisation system where the CO2 removal unit is placed right after the CHP plant to remove the excess air with the aim of improving the energy efficiency of the plant. All four concepts include conversion of CO2 to CO via a reverse water-gas-shift reaction process and subsequent conversion to diesel and gasoline via Fischer--Tropsch synthesis. The studied CCU options are compared in terms of liquid fuel yields, energy requirements, energy efficiencies, capital investment and produc- tion costs. The overall plant energy efficiency and production costs range from 12--17\% and d15.8--29.6 per litre of liquid fuels, respectively. A sensitivity analysis is also carried out to examine the effect of different economic and technical parameters on the production costs of liquid fuels. The results indicate that the production of liquid hydrocarbon fuels using the existing CCU technology is not economically feasible mainly because of the low CO2 separation and conversion efficiencies as well as the high energy requirements. Therefore, future research in this area should aim at developing novel CCU technologies which should primarily focus on opti- mising the CO2 conversion rate and minimising the energy consumption of the plant.},

  abstract = {A new gas turbine-fuel cell Hybrid Cycle is proposed. The fuel cell advantageously operates close or under atmospheric pressure and is fully integrated with the gas turbine that is based on an Inverted Brayton-Joule Cycle. The idea of the invention is to capitalize on the intrinsic oxygen-nitrogen separation characteristic of the fuel cell electrolyte by sending to the Inverted Brayton-Joule Cycle only the anodic flow, which is the one free of nitrogen. In this way the flow that expands in the turbine consists only in steam and carbon dioxide. After the expansion the steam can be easily condensed, separated and pumped up. Therefore the compressor has mainly only to compress the separated carbon dioxide. This effect generates a substantial advantage in term of efficiency and enables separating the carbon dioxide. The new proposed Hybrid Cycle enables to: substantially increase the system efficiency compared to the known gas turbine-fuel cell Hybrid Cycle, maintain the fuel cell operating under or close to atmospheric pressure and separate the carbon dioxide.},

  abstract = {This work uses pilot examples of CO2 enhanced oil recovery to analyze whether and under which circumstances it is exergetically favorable to sequester CO2 through enhanced oil recovery. We find that the net storage efficiency (ratio between the stored and captured CO2) of the carbon capture and storage (CCS)-only projects is maximally 6--56\% depending on the fuel used in the power plants. With the current state of technology, the CCS process will re-emit a minimum of 0.43--0.94\,kg of CO2 per kg of CO2 stored. From thermodynamics point of view, CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with CCS option is not sustainable, i.e., during the life cycle of the process more energy is consumed than the energy produced from oil. For the CCS to be efficient in reducing CO2 levels (1) the exergetic cost of CO2 separation from flue gas should be reduced, and/or (2) the capture process should not lead to additional carbon emission. Furthermore, we find that the exergy recovery factor of CO2-EOR depends on the CO2 utilization factor, which is currently in the low range of 2--4 bbl/tCO2 based on the field data. Exergetically, CO2 EOR with storage option produces 30--40\% less exergy compared to conventional CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects with CO2 supplied from natural sources; however, this leads to storage of {$>$}400\,kg of extra CO2 per barrel of oil produced.},

  abstract = {CO2 direct air capture (DAC) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are per- formed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital ex- penditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/ with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 V/tCO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance DAC's role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy.},

The model evaluates maintenance costs at a subsystem level in order to quantify the effective impact of each aircraft part on the total maintenance cost. An analysis at the subsystem level can offer a more precise cost estimation because the most influential parameters (that is, the cost drivers) should be different for each aircraft part. Emphasis is given on the updating of a cost-estimating model proposed in 1966 that provided equations for the maintenance cost assessment at a subsystem level using the Air Transport Association nomenclature. The reference method is enhanced with additional cost items, and the choice of cost drivers is accurately considered. The application of the developed model shows good accordance with the reference values provided by the International Air Transport Association, and results are compared with the common state-of-the-art methods.},

The model incorporates a comprehensive characterization of four distinct PV technologies linked to different grid voltage levels (LV, MV, HV, EHV). The findings reveal that the inclusion of Alpine solar power, alongside other PV technologies, results in a slightly more cost-effective energy system. The capacity of natural gas storage is significantly influenced by the inclusion or exclusion of Alpine solar power. Furthermore, solar technologies exhibit a high degree of resilience to cost variations, with Alpine PV demonstrating a complementary relationship with other PV technologies rather than direct competition. The optimal installed capacity, ranging from 3 to 5.25 GW, aligns with previous studies led on Alpine PV},

Using multi-objective optimisation techniques, the thermodynamic and thermo-economic performances of all candidate configurations from a general process superstructure are optimised with respect to SNG and electricity cogeneration and its associated investment cost, production cost and plant profitability. The paper demonstrates how both the optimal system configuration, its operating conditions and performances depend on the available technology, catalyst lifetime, process scale and the characteristics of the processed substrate.},

  abstract = {In terms of the decarbonization of industry, transport, electricity generation, and buildings, the production of green hydrogen plays a major role in the strategy of the European Union and Germany. Therefore, the potential environmental impacts of a greener hydrogen production have been analysed taking the three most important water electrolysis technologies alkaline electrolysis (AEC), polymer electrolyte membrane (PEMEC), and solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) into account. To depict a greener hydrogen production, different energy scenarios of Germany --2019, 2030, 2050, and RE (Renewable Energy)-- with an increasing share of wind and solar energy have been considered. The study shows how the potential CO2-eq. of a greener hydrogen production change when applying the different energy scenarios for each technology. On the other hand, the study aims to compare the resulting CO2-eq. with comparative values of conventional and other hydrogen production processes for classification purposes. Moreover, the study compares the CO2-eq. results with comparative values of conven\- tional electricity generation and conventional fuels for cars, assuming that the produced hydrogen is used for electricity generation and as a fuel for cars in order to show CO2 reduction potentials. Besides that, the study compares the Life-Cycle-Impact-Assessment (LCIA) indicators under study to show which technology is poten\- tially the most environmentally friendly one for the respective energy scenario. In summary, it can be stated that the CO2-eq. decrease with an increasing share of wind and solar energy in the energy mix since the share of fossil energies, which are the main drivers of the CO2- eq., decline. Furthermore, the SOEC technology has the lowest CO2-eq. for the energy scenarios in 2019, 2030, and 2050. This applies to the AEC technology for the RE scenario. Regarding the comparative values of conventional and other hydrogen production processes as well as con\- ventional alternatives, only the RE scenario with wind and solar energy provides lower results. Thus, merely the RE scenario is suitable for an environmentally friendly hydrogen production and utilization in order to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, the SOEC technology causes the lowest potential environmental impacts for the energy scenarios in 2019 and 2030, taking all LCIA indicators into account. This applies to the PEMEC tech\- nology for the energy scenario in 2050 and the RE scenario.},

  author = {Gorre, Jachin and Ortloff, Felix and {van Leeuwen}, Charlotte},
  year = {2019},
  journal = {Applied Energy},
  doi = {10/gmbhdr},
  abstract = {The publication gives an overview of the production costs of synthetic methane in a Power-to-Gas process. The production costs depend in particularly on the electricity price and the full load hours of the plant sub-systems electrolysis and methanation. The full-load hours of electrolysis are given by the electricity supply concept. In order to increase the full-load hours of methanation, the size of the intermediate hydrogen storage tank and the size of the methanation are optimised on the basis of the availability of hydrogen. The calculation of the pro- duction costs for synthetic methane are done with economics for 2030 and 2050 and the expenditures are calculated for one year of operation. The sources of volume of purchased electricity are the short-term market, long-term contracts, direct-coupled renewable energy sources or seasonal use of surpluses. Gas sales are either traded on the short-term market or guaranteed by long-term contracts. The calculations show, that an inter- mediate storage tank for hydrogen, adjustment of the methanation size and operating electrolysis and metha- nation separately, increase the workload of the sub-system methanation. The gas production costs can be sig- nificantly reduced. With the future expected development of capital expenditures, operational expenditure, electricity prices, gas costs and efficiencies, an economic production of synthetic natural gas for the years 2030, especially for 2050, is feasible. The results show that Power-to-Gas is an option for long-term, large-scale sea- sonal storage of renewable energy. Especially the cases with high operating hours for the sub-system metha- nation and low electricity prices show gas production costs below the expected market prices for synthetic gas and biogas.},

We estimate marginal costs assuming Nash-Bertrand pricing. We relate trends in consumer welfare and markups to trends in market structure and the composition of products. Although real prices rose, we find that markups decreased substantially, and the fraction of total surplus accruing to consumers increased. Consumer welfare increased over time due to improved product quality and improved production technology.},

  doi = {10.1186/s13068-017-0698-z},
  abstract = {Background: To reduce the environmental impacts of the aviation sector as air traffic grows steadily, the aviation industry has paid increasing attention to bio-based alternative jet fuels (AJFs), which may provide lower life-cycle petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than petroleum jet fuel. This study presents well-to- wake (WTWa) results for four emerging AJFs: ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) from corn and corn stover, and sugar-to-jet (STJ) from corn stover via both biological and catalytic conversion. For the ETJ pathways, two plant designs were examined: integrated (processing corn or corn stover as feedstock) and distributed (processing ethanol as feedstock). Also, three H2 options for STJ via catalytic conversion are investigated: external H2 from natural gas (NG) steam methane reform- ing (SMR), in situ H2, and H2 from biomass gasification. Results: Results demonstrate that the feedstock is a key factor in the WTWa GHG emissions of ETJ: corn- and corn stover-based ETJ are estimated to produce WTWa GHG emissions that are 16 and 73\%, respectively, less than those of petroleum jet. As for the STJ pathways, this study shows that STJ via biological conversion could generate WTWa GHG emissions 59\% below those of petroleum jet. STJ via catalytic conversion could reduce the WTWa GHG emissions by 28\% with H2 from NG SMR or 71\% with H2 from biomass gasification than those of petroleum jet. This study also examines the impacts of co-product handling methods, and shows that the WTWa GHG emissions of corn stover- based ETJ, when estimated with a displacement method, are lower by 11 g CO2e/MJ than those estimated with an energy allocation method. Conclusion: Corn- and corn stover-based ETJ as well as corn stover-based STJ show potentials to reduce WTWa GHG emissions compared to petroleum jet. Particularly, WTWa GHG emissions of STJ via catalytic conversion depend highly on the hydrogen source. On the other hand, ETJ offers unique opportunities to exploit extensive existing corn ethanol plants and infrastructure, and to provide a boost to staggering ethanol demand, which is largely being used as gasoline blendstock.

  abstract = {Most remote and Arctic communities in Canada have the highest carbon intensity of electricity and heating in the country. There is increased interest from many individuals and organizations to successfully integrate renewable energy systems, but many policy and technical barriers persist. This paper presents the current state of the policies and economics affecting the successful installation and operation of renewable energy projects in the three territories in Canada, the northernmost regions. There is a companion paper in the same conference proceedings focusing on the technical and logistical challenges of renewable energy in these locations. Successfully growing the installed capacity of renewable energy in these regions will lead to substantial decarbonization of the energy supply and improve resiliency. This paper summarizes available sources estimating the installation and operating and maintenance costs of solar photovoltaic and wind turbine systems in northern and remote communities in contrast to locations in southern Canada and also in contrast to the cost of diesel-generated electricity. An overview of funding programs is presented, along with description of some of the issues that arise in interfacing funding with current policies. The policies enabling or inhibiting the generation of electricity by independent producers are reviewed in detail, including personal experiences of multiple applicants. Shortcomings and issues with the policies are examined, with recommendations to better enable decarbonization and increased resiliency of building energy in remote and Arctic communities in Canada.},

  abstract = {The paper presents the development of a comprehensive wind atlas of the Province of Quebec. This study differs from previous studies by 1) use of a standard classification index to categorize the wind resource, 2) extensive review of surface and upper air data available for the Province to define the wind resource, and 3) integration of available wind data with the topography of the Province. The wind resource in the Province of Quebec is classified using the scheme proposed by Battelle---Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL). The Battelle---PNL classification is a numerical one which includes rankings from Wind Power Class 1 (lowest) to Wind Power Class 7 (highest). Associated with each numerical classification is a range of wind power and associated mean wind speed at 10 m and 50 m above ground level. For this study, a classification for 30 m above ground level was interpolated and used. A significant amount of wind data was gathered for the Province. These data were obtained from Atmospheric Environment Service (AES), Canada, from wind project developers, and from climatological summaries of surface and upper air data. A total of 35 primary data sites were selected in the Province. Although a number of wind data sites in the Province were identified and used in the analysis, large areas of the Province lacked any specific wind information. The Province was divided into grid blocks having dimensions of 1/4{$^\circ$} latitude by 1/3{$^\circ$} longitude. Each grid block is assigned a numerical Wind Power Class value ranging from 1 to 7. This value is based on the integration of the available wind data and the topography within the square. The majority of the Province was classified as 1 or 2. Coastal locations and topographic features in the interior of the Province typically have Wind Power Class 3 or higher.},

  abstract = {This paper has developed an operation and maintenance (O\&M) model for projected 20 MW tidal stream farm case studies at two sites in the northeast Atlantic in France and at EMEC's Fall of Warness site in the UK. The annual energy production, number of incidents, and downtimes of the farms for corrective and planned (preventive) maintenance strategies are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations that vary weather windows, repair vessel availabilities, and mean annual failure rates modelled by Weibull distributions. The trade-offs between the mean annual failure rates, time availability, O\&M costs, and energy income minus the variable O\&M costs were analysed. For all scenarios, a 5-year planned maintenance strategy could considerably decrease the mean annual failure rates by 37\% at both sites and increase the net energy income. Based on a detailed sensitivity analysis, the study has suggested a simple decision-making method that examines how the variation in the mean annual failure rate and changes in spare-part costs would reduce the effectiveness of a preventive maintenance strategy. This work provides insights into the most important parameters that affect the O\&M cost of tidal stream turbines and their effect on tidal energy management. The output of the study will contribute to decision-making concerning maintenance strategies.},

Biogenic resources are explicitly indicated as carbon-neutral from Life Cycle Assessment perspective by the IPCC, shedding light on the carbon-neutral society by applying Biogenic Energy Carbon Capture for creating negative emissions. This article proposes a novel modeling approach by introducing carbon layers with specification on the principal carbon sources and sinks based upon an optimization algorithm, in order to solve the carbon loop issue in a highly interconnected energy system due to increasing penetration of biomass and carbon capture, use, and storage. This study contributes to quantifying biogenic and nonbiogenic carbon footprints, and optimizing the circular economy associated with a net-zero-emission society, in favor of policy-making for sustainable development in long terms.},

  abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable, fossil-free energy systems is interlinked with a high penetration of stochastic renewables, such as wind and solar. Integrating these new energy resources and technologies will lead to profound structural changes in energy systems, such as an increasing need for storage and a radical electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. To capture the increasing complexity of such future energy systems, new flexible and open-source optimization modelling tools are needed. This paper presents EnergyScope TD, a novel open-source model for the strategic energy planning of urban and regional energy systems. Compared to other existing energy models, which are often proprietary, computationally expensive and mostly focused on the electricity sector, EnergyScope TD optimises both the investment and operating strategy of an entire energy system (including electricity, heating and mobility). Additionally, its hourly resolution (using typical days) makes the model suitable for the integration of intermittent renewables, and its concise mathematical formulation and computational efficiency are appropriate for uncertainty applications. We present the linear programming model, detailing its formulation, and we apply it to a real-world case study to discuss advantages and disadvantages in comparison to other modelling frameworks. In particular, we model the national energy system of Switzerland to evaluate a 50\% renewable energy scenario.},

  abstract = {Humanity is at the beginning of its third energy revolution, after coal and then oil, we are now moving towards the massive use of renewable energies that we knew since the dawn of time. This change will solve several problems, including climate change, as the concentration of greenhouse gases will stabilise. The success of fossil fuels resides in their storability. Indeed, these energies have been stored in the earth for millions of years and can be extracted whenever humans need energy. Their costs of storage are insignificant compared to their costs of extraction. On the contrary, the main renewable energies are intermittent, i.e. wind and solar energy, and thus cannot be stored. However, these energy can be converted into electricity, heat or another form of energy that can be stored. But storing these energy carriers has a significant cost and thus, redefine the design of the energy system. Hence, the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energies - mainly intermittent - requires a complete rethinking of the energy systemsupply chain from resources to demand while including conversion and storage technologies. In particular, to understand what will be the role of storage technologies in this energy system throughout the energy transition period and after. To address this issue, the thesis addresses the following research question: What is the role of energy storage technologies for the energy transition? Focusing on the role of storage requires the inclusion of its environment, i.e. the energy system. Focusing on the energy transition requires a time horizon fromtoday...},

  abstract = {Negative carbon emissions are proved necessary to limit global temperature increase below 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels. (a) Reducing carbon sources and (b) increasing negative emissions are two effective ways to achieve this goal. (a) involves the introduction of renewable energy sources, improved efficiency of energy technologies, and changes in human lifestyles. For (b), the reinforcement of carbon sinks can be realized either in the industrial domain, i.e. by Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), or in nature, i.e. by afforestation and reforestation. However, these measures will entail fundamental changes in the structure of the energy system, involving the conversion, transmission, distribution, and storage of energy, as well as changes on the demand side, such as the transformation from a pure consumer to a prosumer (producer and consumer). The question of how to "achieve the goal of negative carbon emissions rapidly and stably whilst guaranteeing the security of energy supply" has become a hot topic in international academic, political, and economic activities in recent years. With the aim of optimizing energy systems, this study develops a theory for modelling the increasingly complex carbon cycle from a linear to a circular economy. On this basis, a theoretical and methodological approach to parameterize the energy transition is proposed, quantifying and discussing the impact of the carbon emission rate, the timing of the transition on the cumulative carbon emissions, and the cumulative system costs. The results show that (1) Switzerland can achieve negative emissions by 2050, where the energy system can generate -6 million tonnes of annual carbon emissions; at the same time, (2) Switzerland can achieve energy independence, with a 92\% penetration share of renewable energies; (3) the difference in cumulative carbon emissions between the different transition pathways over the next 30 years can reach up to 7 times the 2020's emissions subject to the same negative-emission target, while (4) the difference in cumulative costs is only 10\%. These results highlight the necessity to shift from target dominance to process orientation for energy planning. For the European Union (EU), Switzerland and UK, the model results estimate the carbon emission could achieve lowest to -900 MtCO2-eq/year, but it necessitates the joint effort of the whole society to realize a radical revolution in lifestyle (diet, clothing, living, and travel), technology development (in particular energy and manufacturing sectors), and smart management in land utilization including agriculture and forestry. The results indicate that different pathways of the EU can lead to a global temperature fluctuation of approximately 0.025{$^\circ$}C in 2050. Furthermore, the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) results show that the decarbonization process can significantly diminish the damages caused by human activities to the health and ecosystem (e.g. biodiversity). Nevertheless, low-carbon emissions are demonstrated as merely one necessary but not sufficient condition for the sustainability of the society. For the EU, decarbonization might exacerbate the food shortage, water stress, and depletion of mineral resources. Following the COP26, these side-effects are likely to be amplified, thus calling for joint efforts of the whole society to meet the sustainable demands of human beings},

However, most of the buses in Indian cities run on diesel fuel causing significant emissions and air quality issues. This study aims to quantify the emissions from the buses during peak and off-peak periods using second-by-second activity data collected using global positioning system (GPS) receivers. Four-bus routes plying within the city of Chennai in India was selected and second-by-second speed and acceleration was used to determine the operating mode of the bus. Corresponding emissions were estimated using vehicle specific power (VSP). Results show that the average speed of the bus during peak and off-peak periods were 17.8 kmph and 21.5 kmph, respectively; the corresponding percentages of time idling were 27\% and 22\%. Further, the percentage increase in total emissions of CO2, CO, HC and NOx from the bus during peak periods with respect to off-peak periods was 17\%, 16\%, 37\% and 21\%, respectively. This study provides useful insights regarding the operating and emission characteristics of buses that will be valuable to policy makers in improving their service and efficiency.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an overarching review of national municipal waste management systems and wasteto-energy as an important part of it in the context of circular economy in the selected countries in Europe. The growth of population and rising standards of living means that the consumption of goods and energy is increasing. On the one hand, consumption leads to an increase in the generation of waste. On the other hand, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong as well. Given that the average heating value of municipal solid waste (MSW) is approximately 10 MJ/kg, it seems logical to use waste as a source of energy. Traditionally, waste-to-energy (WtE) has been associated with incineration. Yet, the term is much broader, embracing various waste treatment processes generating energy (for instance, in the form of electricity and/or heat or producing a wastederived fuel). Turning waste into energy can be one key to a circular economy enabling the value of products, materials, and resources to be maintained on the market for as long as possible, minimising waste and resource use. As the circular economy is at the top of the EU agenda, all Member States of the EU (including the EEA countries) should move away from the old-fashioned disposal of waste to a more intelligent waste treatment encompassing the circular economy approach in their waste policies. Therefore, the article examines how these EU policies are implemented in practice. Given that WtE traditionally is attached to the MSW management and organisation, the focus of this article is twofold. Firstly, it aims to identify the different practices of municipal waste management employed in selected countries and their approaches in embracing the circular economy and, secondly, the extent to which WtE technologies play any role in this context. The following countries, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK were chosen to depict a broad European context. {\copyright} 2017 The Authors.

A screening test based on load density indicators, however, reveals that a district heating serving the entire town would probably not be economically viable.

  abstract = {The life cycle of an aircraft consists of design, production, operation and decommissioning phases. For an airline the main focus is on the maintenance process during the operation phase. This paper presents a case study of an airline facing a challenge of increasing maintenance cost. The objective is to understand factors that drive increase in cost. Maintenance cost, flight hours, flight cycles, dispatch reliability and pilot reports were analyzed to find out the maintenance cost drivers. The study identified that the aircraft which dominated the maintenance costs had the highest flight hours, and the lowest dispatch reliability in the fleet.},

  abstract = {Various countries and communities are defining or rethinking their energy strategy driven by con- cerns for climate change and security of energy supply. Energy models, often based on optimization, can support this decision-making process. In the current energy planning practice, most models are deterministic, i.e. they do not consider uncertainty and rely on long-term forecasts for important parameters. However, over the long time horizons of energy planning, forecasts often prove to be inaccurate, which can lead to overcapacity and underutilization of the installed technologies. Although this shows the need of considering uncertainty in energy planning, uncertainty is to date seldom integrated in energy models. The main barriers to a wider penetration of uncertainty are i) the complexity and computational expense of energy models; ii) the issue of quantifying input un- certainties and determining their nature; iii) the selection of appropriate methods for incorporating uncertainties in energy models. To overcome these limitations, this thesis answers the following research question How does uncertainty impact strategic energy planning and how can we facilitate the integration of uncertainty in the energy modeling practice? with four novel methodological contributions. First, a mixed-integer linear programming modeling framework for large-scale energy systems is presented. Given the energy demand, the efficiency and cost of energy conversion technologies, the availability and cost of resources, the model identifies the optimal investment and operation strategies to meet the demand and minimize the total annual cost or greenhouse gas emissions. The concise formulation and low computational time make it suitable for uncertainty applications. Second, a method is introduced to characterize input uncertainties in energy planning models. Third, the adoption of a two-stage global sensitivity analysis approach is proposed to deal with the large number of uncertain parameters in energy planning models. Fourth, a complete robust optimization framework is developed to incorporate uncertainty in optimization- based energy models, allowing the consideration of uncertainty both in the objective function and in the other constraints. To evaluate the impact of uncertainty, the presentation of the methods is systematically associated to their validation on the real case study of the Swiss energy system. In this context, a novelty is represented by the consideration of all uncertain parameters in the analysis. The main finding is that uncertainty dramatically impacts energy planning decisions. The results reveal that uncertainty levels vary significantly for different parameters, and that the way in which uncertainty is charac- terized has a strong impact on the results. In the case study, economic parameters, such as the discount rate and the price of imported resources, are the most impacting inputs; also, parameters which are commonly considered as fixed assumptions in energy models emerge as critical factors, which shows that it is crucial to avoid an a priori exclusion of parameters from the analysis. The energy strategy drastically changes if uncertainty is considered. In particular, it is demonstrated that robust solutions, characterized by a higher penetration of renewables and of efficient technologies, can offer more reliability and stability compared to investment plans made without accounting for uncertainty, at the price of a marginally higher cost.},

  abstract = {This research assesses the well-to-tank (WTT) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic performance of an innovative bio-jet fuel via acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Dutch potato by-products from the food processing industry and sugar beets are explored as potential feedstocks. Four product systems differentiated by feedstocks, logistics and centralized/decentralized fermenters are investigated. For both feedstocks, it is found that a centralized large-scale fermentation is preferable to decentralized small-scale fermentation (25--30\% less expensive and 5\% lower WTT emissions). Once commercialization is reached, the cost and carbon performance of this novel bio-jet fuel could be similar to that of other alcohol-to-jet fuels. Depending on the feedstock and configuration considered, the GHG emission mitigation potential of this novel jet-fuel was estimated between 41\% and 52\%. To meet the EU RED II 65\% GHG reduction criterion, possible options could be using low carbon-intensive processing energy and hydrogen or storing permanently biogenic carbon dioxide from fermentation.},

Hydrogen from renewable energy sources is discussed as an alternative option to replace traditional feedstock and can therefore be part of a low-carbon energy system. This paper describes the results of a simulation of a concept for the production of hydrogen with biomass as feedstock. The described investigations include a possible process design, the process simulation using the software IPSEpro, a description of the operation characteristics, and a profitability analysis of the applied hydrogen production concept. The simulation result shows that 61 MW of hydrogen can be produced from 100 MW wood chips and 6 MW of electricity. As a result, hydrogen production costs of 54 {\texteuro}/MWh can be estimated. For the investigated concept, the wood chip price is the most important factor for the hydrogen production cost followed by investment costs for the plant and the realized plant operation time per year.},

  abstract = {Technical energy regulations are an important measure to reach climate targets. However, with recent developments in new technologies (such as decentralized energy systems, urban energy systems, energy storage systems, etc.) many different options and combination of measures exist to decarbonize the building stock, which requires an update of current versions of technical energy regulations. The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal transformation strategies for buildings and districts to reach CO2 emission reduction targets for the Swiss building stock, to support policies and decision makers in developing new energy regulations for the future. A simulation approach is developed, which combines clustering methods, to define representative buildings and districts, with multi-objective optimization to investigate the optimal set of building and district measures to minimize costs and CO2 emissions. Results at building level show that the most economical measures for reaching emission targets for the future include roof retrofitting and window replacement together with PV installation. In terms of heating systems, biomass or heat pumps seem to be the most favourable option. The analysis of district archetypes shows that district level solutions are mainly applicable to urban communities, whereas building level solutions are clearly the optimal solution for rural areas.},

  abstract = {We present the first comprehensive estimate of the final energy demand for heat in all EU28 member states for the reference year 2012, differentiated by temperature levels, comparing two different approaches. Two different calculation approaches based on different data sets yielded estimates of the total final energy demand for heat in the EU28 of 8150 PJ and 8518 PJ in 2012, respectively. Approach 1 distinguishes between three different process heat (PH) temperature levels and results in final energy demand for heat {$<$}100{$^\circ$}C: 2077 PJ, 100--400{$^\circ$}C: 2214 PJ and {$>$}400{$^\circ$}C: 3859 PJ. The second approach distinguishes between low temperature space heat and hot water ({$<$}100{$^\circ$}C: 1161 PJ) and four different PH temperature levels with a resulting energy demand of {$<$}100{$^\circ$}C: 1027 PJ, 100--500{$^\circ$}C: 1785 PJ, 500--1000{$^\circ$}C: 1679 PJ and {$>$}1000{$^\circ$}C: 2865 PJ. The high share of high-temperature heat illustrates the limits to the potential decarbonisation of industrial thermal processes with renewable energy sources such as (non-concentrating) solar thermal, geothermal or environmental heat. Therefore specific information on required temperature levels is of the essence. This, in turn, points out the relevance of renewable electricity and synthetic fuels based on renewable power for a significant reduction of CO2 emissions from the industry sector in Europe. Considering current data quality, it is recommended to develop a consistent, comprehensive methodology to significantly improve the data basis on industrial heat demand. Copyright},

  abstract = {The paper presents the application of a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) methodology to optimize multi-biomass and natural gas supply chain strategic design for heat and power generation in urban areas. The focus is on spatial and temporal allocation of biomass supply, storage, processing, transport and energy conversion (heat and CHP) to match the heat demand of residential end users. The main aim lies on the assessment of the trade-offs between centralized district heating plants and local heat generation systems, and on the decoupling of the biomass processing and biofuel energy conversion steps. After a brief description of the methodology, which is presented in detail in Part I of the research, an application to a generic urban area is proposed. Moreover, the influence of energy demand typologies (urban areas energy density, heat consumption patterns, buildings energy efficiency levels, baseline energy costs and available infrastructures) and specific constraints of urban areas (transport logistics, air emission levels, space availability) on the selection of optimal bioenergy pathways for heat and power is assessed, by means of sensitivity analysis. On the basis of these results, broad considerations about the key factors influencing the use of bioenergy into urban energy systems are proposed. Potential further applications of this model are also described, together with main barriers for development of bioenergy routes for urban areas.},

  abstract = {Biomass is the major source of renewable carbon which can be used to substitute fossil carbon in fuels and chemical products. This thesis addresses the modelling, design and thermo- economic evaluation and optimisation of processes converting Biomass to Liquids (BtL) for the effective exploitation of a renewable, yet limited, resource. The focus is on thermochemical conversion, through gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis, producing drop-in fuels which could be used in the current infrastructure. Given the number of potential technological options and process configurations, a methodol- ogy is developed for a systematic comparison in terms of several performance indicators. The analysis is carried out through a framework combining thermochemical modelling, economic evaluation, process integration and multi-objective optimisation. Particular attention is given to the representation of biomass and its coherent modelling in terms of its elemental composition. Experimental data from previous studies is used to develop new thermochemical models for torrefaction and for fluidized bed gasification. Other technologies included in this study are air and steam drying, entrained flow gasification, tar reforming, high temperature tar cracking, water and gas quench and radiant panels, hot and cold gas cleaning, water gas shift, high temperature steam and steam/carbon dioxide electrolysis and F-T synthesis and upgrading. The final comparison, through the multi-objective optimisation, provides a better under- standing of the trade-offs of different technological options and process variables in terms of competing economic and thermodynamic objectives. For 200 MWt h biomass input plant capacities, production costs are in the range of 1.0-1.4 e/l for technologies producing up to about 0.5 kJF T /kJt h and close to being neutral in terms of electricity balance. For technologies using electrolysis the conversion can increase to 0.8 kJF T /kJt h with production costs of 1.8 e/l. The electricity storage capacity, in this case, is of 0.5 kJe /kJF T , corresponding to a net electricity requirement of about 0.4 kJe /kJt h . This work stems from the collaboration between LTB (Biomass Technology Laboratory) of CEA/Liten in Grenoble, France, and IPESE (Industrial Process and Energy Systems Engineer- ing) of EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The energy efficiency of different biogas systems, including single and co-digestion of multiple feedstock, different biogas utilization pathways, and waste-stream management strategies was evaluated. The input data were derived from assessment of existing biogas systems, present knowledge on anaerobic digestion process management and technologies for biogas system operating conditions in Germany. The energy balance was evaluated as Primary Energy Input to Output (PEIO) ratio, to assess the process energy efficiency, hence, the potential sustainability. Results indicate that the PEIO correspond to 10.5--64.0\% and 34.1--55.0\% for single feedstock digestion and feedstock co-digestion, respectively. Energy balance was assessed to be negative for feedstock transportation distances in excess of 22km and 425km for cattle manure and for Municipal Solid Waste, respectively, which defines the operational limits for respective feedstock transportation. Energy input was highly influenced by the characteristics of feedstock used. For example, agricultural waste, in most part, did not require pre-treatment. Energy crop feedstock required the respect cultivation energy inputs, and processing of industrial waste streams included energy-demanding pre-treatment processes to meet stipulated hygiene standards. Energy balance depended on biogas yield, the utilization efficiency, and energy value of intended fossil fuel substitution. For example, obtained results suggests that, whereas the upgrading of biogas to biomethane for injection into natural gas network potentially increased the primary energy input for biogas utilization by up to 100\%; the energy efficiency of the biogas system improved by up to 65\% when natural gas was substituted instead of electricity. It was also found that, system energy efficiency could be further enhanced by 5.1--6.1\% through recovery of residual biogas from enclosed digestate storage units. Overall, this study provides bases for more detailed assessment of environmental compatibility of energy efficiency pathways in biogas production and utilization, including management of spent digestate.},

  abstract = {Capturing CO2 from air, referred to as air capture, is being proposed as a viable climate change mitigation technology. Technically, air capture is not a new technology; industrial applications can be traced back to the 1930s. This paper explores the feasibility of this technology as a climate change mitigation option. Two different pathways of air capture are assessed: direct air capture, which uses a chemical process to capture CO2, and biomass coupled with CO2 capture and storage (CCS), which utilizes the biological process of photosynthesis to remove CO2 from the air. We find that direct air capture has prohibitively high mitigation costs compared to the costs of climate change mitigation options being considered today. The pathway of biomass coupled with CCS has much more reasonable costs and could be used to offset certain emissions. However, the large land requirement may limit the amount of offsets available. We conclude that relying on air capture technology to play a major role in mitigating carbon emissions is a very risky policy decision.},

As such technological improvements for cleaner power generation and better environmental performance are crucial. Power generation by coal also causes many environmental externalities, which requires comprehensive scientific analysis to develop appropriate cleaner production measures for ecological and energy conservations. A cleaner coal-fired power plant at Sahiwal, Pakistan has been recently installed and started electricity generation under a bilateral economic initiative known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project. This study is aimed to analyse the life cycle impacts of process stages (material and coal transportation, and plant operations) of this coal-fired power plant. Functional unit of 1~MWh of electricity generated has been selected to depict the results, which reveal highest impact score in the climate change potential category (7.41E+02~kg CO2 eq.) whereas, least impact was noted in stratospheric ozone depletion category (8.27E-08~kg CFC11 eq.) The operational stage of the plant has been a major impact contributor in all the selected midpoint categories except for human toxicity potential. Overall, this power plant is effectively reducing its eco-footprint because of cleaner supercritical power generation technology, high thermal efficiency, lesser CO2 emissions and modern pollution monitoring and management system. Real-time scientific cleaner energy-management as presented in this study can help in the development of optimal policy framework to steer cleaner coal power generation in developing countries for a greater energy sustainability.},

  abstract = {Designing district-scale energy systems with renewable energy sources is still a challenge, as it involves modeling of multiple loads and many options to combine energy system components. In the current study, two different energy system scenarios for a district in Montreal/Canada are compared to choose the most cost-effective and energy-efficient energy system scenario for the studied area. In the first scenario, a decentral energy system comprised of ground-source heat pumps provides heating and cooling for each building, while, in the second scenario, a district heating and cooling system with a central heat pump is designed. Firstly, heating and cooling demand are calculated in a completely automated process using an Automatic Urban Building Energy Modeling System approach (AUBEM). Then, the Integrated Simulation Environment Language (INSEL) is used to prepare a model for the energy system. The proposed model provides heat pump capacity and the number of required heat pumps (HP), the number of photovoltaic (PV) panels, and AC electricity generation potential using PV. After designing the energy systems, the piping system, heat losses, and temperature distribution of the centralized scenario are calculated using a MATLAB code. Finally, two scenarios are assessed economically using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) method. The results show that the central scenario's total HP electricity consumption is 17\% lower than that of the decentral systems and requires less heat pump capacity than the decentral scenario. The LCOE of both scenarios varies from 0.04 to 0.07 CAD/kWh, which is cheaper than the electricity cost in Quebec (0.08 CAD/kWh). A comparison between both scenarios shows that the centralized energy system is cost-beneficial for all buildings and, after applying the discounts, the LCOE of this scenario decreases to 0.04 CAD/kWh.},

  abstract = {Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) is useful to evaluate the environmental performance of current and emerging technologies in the future. Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technol\- ogies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improve\- ments are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},
  langid = {english},
  note = {Summary
\par
premise is an open-source Python library that generates prospective LCI databases based on the results of IAM (in this case, REMIND and IMAGE). The method can be applied to different versions of ecoinvent and covers different sectors (power generation, cement, steel and fuel production). 
\par
``{$\bullet$} electricity generation: regional markets for biomass and electricity, efficiency update of power plants (including photovoltaic panels) 
\par
{$\bullet$} steel and cement production: regional markets for primary and secondary steel, as well as cement, and efficiency update of primary and secondary steel and clinker production 
\par
{$\bullet$} liquid and gaseous fuels production: regional markets for fuels (including biomass-based and synthetic fuels), CO2 emissions update of fuel-consuming activities 
\par
{$\bullet$} road transport: regional fleet average vehicles, notably medium- and heavy-duty trucks'' (Sacchi et al., 2022, p. 5)
\par
Main limitations:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Bad harmonization/match between LCI and IAM modeled technologies. For instance, LCI distinguishes several types of steel whereas IAM may have one. 
\item Reliance on external data that could lead to inconsistencies. 
\item Difficulty to have reliable results after 2050. For instance, impossibility to anticipate disruptive technology shifts. 
\item Highly uncertain results regarding toxicity-related indicators, due to the lack of information regarding the toxicity of chemicals in the future.

  abstract = {In decentralized energy systems, electricity generated and flexibility offered by households can be organized in the form of community energy systems. Business models, which enable this aggregation at the community level, will impact on the involved actors and the electricity market. For the case of Germany, in this paper different aggregation scenarios are analyzed from the perspective of actors and the market. The main components in these scenarios are the Community Energy Storage (CES) technology, the electricity tariff structure, and the aggregation goal. For this evaluation, a bottom-up community energy system model is presented, in which the households and retailer are the key actors. In our model, we distinguish between the households with inflexible electricity load and the flexible households that own a heat pump or Photovoltaic (PV) storage systems. By using a game-theoretic approach and modeling the interaction between the retailer and households as a Stackelberg game, a community real-time pricing structure is derived. To find the solution of the modeled Stackelberg game, a genetic algorithm is implemented. To analyze the impact of the aggregation scenarios on the electricity market, a ``Market Alignment Indicator'' is proposed. The results show that under the considered regulatory framework, the deployment of a CES can increase the retailer's operational profits while improving the alignment of the community energy system with the signals from the electricity market. Depending on the aggregation goal of the retailer, the implementation of community real-time pricing could lead to a similar impact. Moreover, such a tariff structure can lead to financial benefits for flexible households.},

  author = {Schnidrig, Jonas},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {The paradigm shift in the energy policy of the European Union confronts the member states with the task of developing future renewable and fossil-free energy systems. This change involves the installation of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, which induce a demand for storage capacity. The modelling of smart cities with electrified mobility allows the optimisation of mobility and renewable energy combination. However, in order to analyse the system as a whole, system-based cross-sectoral energy models have to be used, including intersectoral exchange. Within this thesis the system-based and cross-sectoral energy planning tool EnergyScope will be adapted to mobility, in order to analyse the influence of different vehicle technologies on the energy system of two main agents of the European Union. Historical mobility data was analysed to predict the mobility behaviour of France and Germany for the year 2050. These estimates were integrated into two EnergyScope models with different temporal resolution and optimized according to thermoeconomic criteria. The model with the monthly resolution allowed to estimate the impact of vehicles with batteries, fuel cells, synthetic fuels and biofuels on the whole energy system. The model based on typical days allowed to visualize the influence of smart mobility such as vehicle-to-grid technologies in electric vehicle composition. The efficiency of the monthly model also allowed a Morris and Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis of the estimated parameters. The results show that the vehicle composition strongly depend on the existing renewable energy potential, with electric vehicles being the preferred technology for private passenger transport. Fuel cells are preferably used for road freight transport where electric trains cannot take over. Despite different energy strategies of France and Germany, the optimized energy systems differ mainly in primary energy consumption, with the installed technologies being largely the same. The promotion of synthetic or biofuels leads to an increase in primary energy demand, which pushes up emissions and costs compared to electrically based mobility. Hydrogen benefits from the possibility of energy storage through power-to-gas, although fuel cells for private mobility are not the pareto-optimal solution due to their higher purchase price compared to electric vehicles},

  abstract = {A successful decarbonisation of the European Union, coupled with a high integration of renewable energy and ambitious targets for energy efficiency, can only be reached with a significant contribution from the transporta- tion sector. It currently represents a quarter of the total greenhouse gas emissions and is shifting from fossil fuels to alternative energy carriers (biofuels, e-hydrogen, electricity) and propulsion systems (hybrid, electric and fuel-cell vehicles). Decarbonising this sector can follow multiple pathways, each having different costs, im- pacts and implications for the other sectors (industry, residential and services). This paper presents a method to analyse the impact of each decarbonisation pathway in the mobility sector on the overall energy system, using the EnergyScope model. The proposed methods include: (i) an estimation of the hourly demand profiles for short- (local) and long-distance mobility, using annual projections and traffic measurements; (ii) the devel- opment of black-box vehicle models of road, rail and aviation technologies; (iii) the modelling of the associated infrastructures, from the fuel conversion processes to the charging stations; and (iv) the use of Monte-Carlo- based tools to account for technical and economic uncertainties. This method allows to assess the effects of mobility decarbonisation pathways on the energy system, from the large-scale deployment of vehicle-to-grid technologies to the integration of biofuel- and hydrogen-based vehicles. France has been taken as case study, considering 2050 as time horizon. The results showed the importance of a holistic approach to suggest cost- and energy-efficient decarbonisation pathways in the transport sector that can affect the overall energy system},

  abstract = {The transition towards renewable energy is leading to an important strain on the energy grids. The question of designing and deploying renewable energy technologies in symbiosis with existing grids and infrastructure is arising. While current energy system models mainly focus on the energy transformation system or only investigate the effect on one energy vector grid, we present a methodology to characterize different energy vector grids and storage, integrated into the multi-energy and multi-sector modeling framework EnergyScope. The characterization of energy grids is achieved through a traditional energy technology and grid modeling approach, integrating economic and technical parameters. The methodology has been applied to the case study of a country with a high existing transmission infrastructure density, e.g., Switzerland, switching from a fossil fuel-based system to a high share of renewable energy deployment. The results show that the economic optimum with high shares of renewable energy requires the electric distribution grid reinforcement with 2.439~GW (+61\%) Low Voltage (LV) and 4.626~GW (+82\%) Medium Voltage (MV), with no reinforcement required at transmission level [High Voltage (HV) and Extra High Voltage (EHV)]. The reinforcement is due to high shares of LV-Photovoltaic (PV) (15.4~GW) and MV-wind (20~GW) deployment. Without reinforcement, additional biomass is required for methane production, which is stored in 4.8--5.95~TWh methane storage tanks to compensate for seasonal intermittency using the existing gas infrastructure. In contrast, hydro storage capacity is used at a maximum of 8.9~TWh. Furthermore, the choice of less efficient technologies to avoid reinforcement results in a 8.5\%--9.3\% cost penalty compared to the cost of the reinforced system. This study considers a geographically averaged and aggregated model, assuming all production and consumption are made in one single spot, not considering the role of future decentralization of the energy system, leading to a possible overestimation of grid reinforcement needs.},

  abstract = {Accurate fuel burn estimation models are required to assess potential reductions in CO2 emissions stemming from new aircraft technologies. This study provides a novel framework for Fuel Estimation in Air Transportation (FEAT): a two-component approach comprising of (1) a high fidelity flight profile simulator based on the aircraft performance model from EUROCONTROL, and (2) a reduced order fuel consumption approximation with origin-destination airport pair and aircraft type as sole inputs. The latter allows for accurately estimating fuel consumption for global scheduled aircraft movements of an entire year in a matter of milliseconds. We calculate total CO2 emissions from scheduled commercial aviation in 2018 to be 812 Mt. The modeling error of fuel consumption is validated against fuel burn reports and ranges below 5\%. Current aircraft performance models either focus on fuel estimation accuracy or on computational efficiency. Combining both, FEAT enables rapid assessment of decarbonization strategies for commercial passenger aviation.},

In this study, integration of an on board CO2 capture and storage unit with an internal combustion engine has been proposed. The technology can be applied for various internal combustion or Stirling engines with targeted applications in the transportation sector. Truck transport for goods delivery is used as an example for on board CO2 capture and storage system design. The investigated system integrates a temperature swing adsorption system for CO2 capture with a turbo-compressor system to compress and liquefy the captured CO2 using the waste heat of the exhaust gases of the engine. Energy and exergy analyses of the proposed CO2 captured system are studied in details. The CO2 capture system for engine exhaust stream (car, truck, bus, ship or train) can capture 90\% of the emitted CO2, without any energy penalty. This system can be integrated into overall mobility system (fuel-engine-CO2-fuel), where captured CO2 can be recycled as conventional liquid or gaseous fuels produced from renewable energy sources.

  abstract = {The techno-economic performance analysis of biofuel production and electric power generation from biomass fast pyrolysis and bio-oil hydroprocessing is explored through process simulation. In this work, a process model of 72 MT/day pine wood fast pyrolysis and bio-oil hydroprocessing plant was developed with rate based chemical reactions using Aspen Plus{\`O} process simulator. It was observed from simulation results that 1 kg s􏰝1 pine wooddb generate 0.64 kg s􏰝1 bio-oil, 0.22 kg s􏰝1 gas and 0.14 kg s􏰝1 char. Simu- lation results also show that the energy required for drying and fast pyrolysis operations can be provided from the combustion of pyrolysis by-products, mainly, char and non-condensable gas with sufficient residual energy for miniature electric power generation. The intermediate bio-oil product from the fast pyrolysis process is upgraded into gasoline and diesel via a two-stage hydrotreating process, which was implemented by a pseudo-first order reaction of lumped bio-oil species followed by the hydrocrack- ing process in this work. Simulation results indicate that about 0.24 kg s􏰝1 of gasoline and diesel range products and 96 W of electric power can be produced from 1 kg s􏰝1 pine wooddb. The effect of initial bio- mass moisture content on the amount of electric power generated and the effect of biomass feed compo- sition on product yields were also reported in this study. Aspen Process Economic Analyser{\`O} was used for equipment sizing and cost estimation for an nth plant and the product value was estimated from discounted cash flow analysis assuming the plant operates for 20 years at a 10\% annual discount rate. Economic analysis indicates that the plant will require {\pounds}16.6 million of capital investment and product value is estimated at {\pounds}6.25/GGE. Furthermore, the effect of key process and economic parameters on product value and the impact of electric power generation equipment on capital cost and energy efficiency were also discussed in this study.},

  abstract = {The urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is greater now than ever, with the impacts of climate change becoming more apparent each year. Due to this, governments are setting ambitious targets such as reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050, as announced by Canada in November of 2020. Within this context, the energy transition continues to gain momentum, as energy systems currently contribute to a large portion of these emissions. In order to support the energy transition, researchers, planners and policy makers alike are considering alternative solutions, such hydrogen, and are becoming increasingly reliant on energy system models in order to determine how the energy systems of the future should evolve. This thesis adapts an optimization based energy system model called EnergyScope in order to model potential pathways for the production and utilization of hydrogen within an energy system. Further, different methods of the definition of regions within energy system models are considered. The EnergyScope model is adapted from a model based on regions defined by political boundaries, to a model based on regions defined by geographic and demographic characteristics. A method for defining these regions and integrating them into the model is developed. These models are then used to assess how Canada could meet its goal of reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 within the energy sector, and what role hydrogen could play in this future energy system. The results highlight the importance of electrification in achieving a net zero energy system, indicating that the future system will be mainly based on renewable electricity generated by PV, wind and solar technologies. This will be used to fulfill the energy demand of the electricity sector, as well as the heating and transportation sectors, which will be mostly electrified. The results also indicate that hydrogen has a potential role to play in energy storage and heating in this net zero energy system, storing electricity when it is produced in excess and being used directly for heating (in place of electricity) when electricity generation is lower. The model indicates that hydrogen will likely be produced by emission free technologies such as natural gas pyrolysis and electrolysis, although uncertainty remains as these technologies are still maturing. Further, it is shown that the definition of regions used in energy system models based on demographic and geographic characteristics, rather than political boundaries, can provide additional insights particularly regarding the distribution of the potential of variable renewable technologies such as wind and solar, and how this corresponds to the distribution of demands and energy resource exchange networks},

The concentration of water (as a component improving acetic acid selectivity) in the reactionfeed was varied. Heat and mass balances were predicted. Finally, the ethane direct oxidation process was compared to acetic acid productionby methanol carbonylation and the investment and production costs are discussed.},

  abstract = {In the project ``Carbon Flows in the Energy Transition'', a methodology is developed to monitor and assess the energy and carbon flows in the energy system of Switzerland. As the flows of carbon, either in the form of released CO2 or stored in chemicals, are linked to the form and operation of the energy system, the design of the latter is crucial. Since the defossilization of the energy system is an important part to reach climate agreement goals, emphasis is given in renewables and biogenic carbon-containing resources, such as various forms of biomass and waste. The potential of carbon and energy sources in Switzerland are evaluated in the first part of the project. In Switzerland, there is a yearly potential of 3.2 Mt wood (dry substance) and 3.1 Mt non-woody biomass (dry substance) for energetic use. Another carbon source is carbon dioxide from air or flue gases. While air has a small carbon dioxide content of 410 ppm, industrial sources provide flue gases with higher concentrations: cement plants (3.29 MtCO2/y), waste incineration plants (4.25 MtCO2/y) and sewage- treatment and biogas plants (1.1 MtCO2/y). Renewable energy sources are restricted as well. The above mentioned potential of wood corresponds to 14 TWh/y. The energy strategy from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) calculates with a potential of 38.6 TWh/y hydro power and 4.3 TWh/y wind power. A newly published study shows a potential for PV and thermal solar energy of totally 67 TWh per year, installed on roofs and building faces. In the first part the demand in heat, mobility and electricity is evaluated as well. In the year 2017, the demand in space heating was 66.4 TWh/y, in hot water 12.7 TWh/y, in high temperature process heat 26.5 TWh/y and the demand in electricity was 40.9 TWh/y. Passengers travelled in total 132' 200 Mpkm, and freight was transported over 44'000 Mtkm. The demand in electricity was covered by hydro dams (20.72 TWh/y), running river hydro plants (15.95 TWh/y), nuclear power plants (19.50 TWh/y), combined heat and power plants, incl. waste incineration (2.80 TWh/y), PV (2.28 TWh/y) and wind power plants (0.22 TWh/y). Heat and mobility was covered by fossil fuels: Light fuel oil (35.54 TWh), Natural gas (33.03 TWh), diesel (31.82 TWh), gasoline (27.67 TWh) and jet fuels (21.10 TWh). Wood provided with 13.73 TWh also a large amount of energy. Heat pumps produced 4.64 TWh, and 0.69 TWh heat was provided by thermal solar. In the second part of the project, energy and carbon conversion technologies (around 120 in total) were evaluated. These technologies include power plants, technologies for heating, cogeneration, mobility and transport, as well as biomass technologies, power-to-X-technologies and others. The resulting data is incorporated into the existing infrastructure of Swiss EnergyScope (SES), an optimization algorithm for the design of energy systems and applied for the case of Switzerland. Using a formulation to account for the carbon content of the various streams within the energy system, both the energy and carbon flows can be tracked during the design of different scenarios related to future energy policies. A selected number of indicative scenarios are presented that can be used to investigate the necessary future actions towards nuclear phasing-out, defossilization and CO2 taxation to name a few, with regard to the energy and carbon emissions profile of Switzerland.},

  abstract = {The focus and challenge for energy engineering in the context of rapid climate change is summarised by the Europe 20-20-20 targets, committing to a reduction in energy consumption of 20\%. The most logical approach to achieve these goals is to target the most energy intensive sectors, namely residential and industrial. In the residential sector, centralised district energy networks are favoured as the best means of heat distribution. They have been constantly evolving, from high temperature steam generated by fossil fuel resources, to water-based solutions supplying heat at the required temperature using renewable electricity. In the industrial sector, process integration must be per- formed on site, to ensure optimal resource utilisation and recovery is achieved. Extending these concepts, heat and mass integration must also be performed between different industries, and between industry and other sectors, such as residential. This enables systems thinking to revolu- tionise the current production system toward more efficient and sustainable solutions, leveraging connectivity to maximise the usage of energy and material resources. In this context, this thesis addresses a series of open questions and offers methods and solutions for improvement. Chapter 1 addresses the lack of demand data in the residential sector. In view of this, it presents a geographically parameterized residential sector profile based on heating signature models for heating and cooling demands, on real consumption profiles for domestic hot water and on Swiss society of engineers and architects norms for electricity and refrigeration. Additional demands such as mobility and waste treatment are also provided. The following chapter makes use of the sector profile introduced in Chapter 1 to integrate the latest refrigerant-based district energy network in four climate zones in Europe. Additional to the state of the art CO2 network, this chapter examines many possibilities of natural resource valorization, such as fresh water thermal sources (e.g. lakes), geothermal sources (geothermal wells), municipal waste and solar energy. The contributions of each additional urban resource is highlighted and the variations across the climate zones in Europe are underlined. Chapter 3 takes the parameterized sector profile one step further, extending the boundaries to include consumption of major products and their associated production requirements. The urban profile is thus extended to include industrial production from 10 different industries, namely oil refining, cement, brewing, aluminum, steel, waste incineration, sugar, pulp and paper, plastics, and dairy production. The temperature-enthalpy profiles of the different industries were taken from previously-developed industrial blueprints, while the production data was considered according to European reference documents. The updated parameterized sector profile is utilised in this chapter to study industrial waste heat recovery potential for three typical European city scales (those of Zurich, Munich and London) and a real city (Rotterdam,NL) with its 4 main oil refineries and cement plants and the city brewery. Chapter 4 bridges the gap between building- and urban-scale analysis, therefore adding a more precise spatial scale to the optimisation problems, and proposes a method to integrate renewable energy and low-carbon resources in cities. This thesis contributes to the field of future urban energy system planning by developing models and methods for generating optimal solutions to efficient urban energy provision. Results from each chapter show large improvement potentials in energy requirements and associated environmental impacts which could lead to zero- or negative-emission, autonomous cities.},

Les objectifs de cette {\'e}tude sont donc de : {$\bullet$} {\'E}tablir l'{\'e}tat actuel du march{\'e} des v{\'e}hicules routiers et de leurs carburants. {$\bullet$} D{\'e}terminer, {\`a} partir de la litt{\'e}rature, les donn{\'e}es de CAPEX et d'OPEX fixe et variable associ{\'e}es aux v{\'e}hicules routiers {\`a} l'{\'e}tude du volet ACV environnementale. {$\bullet$} D{\'e}terminer, {\`a} partir de la litt{\'e}rature, les donn{\'e}es de CAPEX et d'OPEX fixe et variable associ{\'e}es {\`a} la production des carburants {\`a} l'{\'e}tude du volet ACV environnementale. Les d{\'e}penses en immobilisations, commun{\'e}ment appel{\'e}es CAPEX, sont des fonds utilis{\'e}s par une entreprise pour acqu{\'e}rir, moderniser et entretenir des biens mat{\'e}riels tels que des biens, des b{\^a}timents, une usine industrielle, une technologie ou de l'{\'e}quipement. Les d{\'e}penses en capital sur les immobilisations peuvent inclure : la r{\'e}paration d'un b{\^a}timent, l'achat d'une pi{\`e}ce d'{\'e}quipement, la construction d'une nouvelle usine, etc. Une d{\'e}pense op{\'e}rationnelle (OPEX) est l'argent qu'une entreprise d{\'e}pense au jour le jour pour g{\'e}rer une entreprise ou un syst{\`e}me. Selon l'entreprise, ces d{\'e}penses peuvent aller de l'encre utilis{\'e}e pour imprimer des documents aux salaires vers{\'e}s aux employ{\'e}s. Les d{\'e}penses op{\'e}rationnelles sont {\'e}galement divis{\'e}es en deux cat{\'e}gories, les co{\^u}ts d'op{\'e}ration fixes et les co{\^u}ts d'op{\'e}ration variables.

  abstract = {This study summarizes the detailed techno-economic analysis of the ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) process based on two different feedstocks (corn grain and corn stover) at the plant scale of 2000 dry metric tons per day. Ethanol biologically derived from biomass is upgraded catalytically to jet blendstocks via alcohol de- hydration, olefin oligomerization, and hydrotreating. In both pathways, corn-grain-derived ethanol to jet (corn mill ETJ) and corn-stover-derived ethanol to jet (corn stover ETJ), there are portions of gasoline and diesel produced as coproducts. Two cost bases are used in this study: the minimum jet fuel selling prices (MJSP) for jet-range blendstocks and the minimum fuel selling prices (MFSP) for all the hydro- carbons (gasoline, jet, and diesel) produced using a gallon gasoline equivalent (GGE) basis. The nth-plant MJSPs for the two pathways are estimated to be \$4.20 per gal for corn mill and \$6.14 per gal for corn stover, while MFSPs are \$3.91 per GGE for corn mill and \$5.37 per GGE for corn stover. If all of the hydro- carbon products (gasoline, jet, and diesel ranges) can be considered as fuel blendstocks using a GGE basis, the total hydrocarbon yield for fuel blendstock is 49.6 GGE per dry ton biomass for corn stover and 71.0 GGE per dry ton biomass for corn grain. The outcome of this study shows that the renewable jet fuel could be cost competitive with fossil derived jet fuel if further improvements could be made to increase process yields (particularly yields of sugars, sugar to ethanol, and ethanol to hydrocarbons), research and development of sustainable feedstocks, and more effective catalytic reaction kinetics. Pioneer plant ana- lysis, which considers the increased capital investment and the decreased plant performance over the nth-plant analysis, is also performed, showing a potential 31\%--178\% increase in cost compared to the nth- plant assumptions for the dry mill pathway, but with a much wider range of 69\%--471\% cost increase over the nth-plant assumptions for the corn stover pathway. While there are large differences between the esti- mated first of a kind plant cost and the targeted nth-plant case, reduction of costs is possible through improvement of the overall process efficiency, yields, reduction in overall capital, co-product revenues and strategically improve performance by process learnings.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Purpose               To date, very few studies have attempted to quantify the environmental impacts of a wave energy converter, and almost all of these focus solely on the potential climate change impacts and embodied energy. This paper presents a full life cycle assessment (LCA) of the first-generation Pelamis wave energy converter, aiming to contribute to the body of published studies and examine any potential trade-offs or co-benefits across a broad range of environmental impacts.                                         Methods               The process-based attributional LCA was carried out on the full cradle-to-grave life cycle of the Pelamis P1 wave energy converter, including the device, its moorings and sub-sea connecting cable up to the point of connection with the grid. The case study was for a typical wave farm located off the north-west coast of Scotland. Foreground data was mostly sourced from the manufacturer. Background inventory data was mostly sourced from the ecoinvent database (v3.3), and the ReCiPe and CED impact assessment methods were applied.                                         Results and discussion               The Pelamis was found to have significantly lower environmental impacts than conventional fossil generation in 6 impact categories, but performed worse than most other types of generation in 8 of the remaining 13 categories studied. The greatest impacts were from steel manufacture and sea vessel operations. The device performs quite well in the two most frequently assessed impacts for renewable energy converters: climate change and cumulative energy demand. The carbon payback period is estimated to be around 24~months (depending on the emissions intensity of the displaced generation mix), and the energy return on investment is 7.5. The contrast between this and the poor performance in other impact categories demonstrates the limitations of focussing only on carbon and energy.                                         Conclusions               The Pelamis was found to generally have relatively high environmental impacts across many impact categories when compared to other types of power generation; however, these are mostly attributable to the current reliance on fossil fuels in the global economy and the early development stage of the technology. Opportunities to reduce this also lie in reducing requirements for steel in the device structure, and decreasing the requirements for sea vessel operations during installation, maintenance and decommissioning.},

  abstract = {This report presents an overview of current costs of power-to-gas (PtG) plants that produce me- thane, including investment costs, operational costs and feedstock costs. The costs are estimated based on literature sources and data from the STORE\&GO demonstration plants that are currently built in Falkenhagen (Germany), Solothurn (Switzerland) and Troia (Italy). The report first gives an overview of the investment and operational costs for the different PtG plant components: the elec- trolyser, hydrogen storage, methanation reactor, CO2 storage, compressors, pipelines, gas grid in- jection, refuelling station and oxygen and heat capture. Next, total costs are determined for regular- sized PtG plants according to nowadays standards (1 -- 5 MW electrical input). Feedstock costs -- water, electricity and CO2 -- are also discussed. The costs presented in this report will serve as a starting point for further analysis of future cost developments of the PtG technology due to learning effects and economies of scale in STORE\&GO deliverable 7.5a, and will also be used as an input for PtG business calculations in STORE\&GO deliverable 8.6b. Although this report presents already some costs of the three STORE\&GO demonstration plants, not all costs could be provided at this point in the project since the plants are still being constructed. A detailed evaluation of the costs of the three demonstration plants will be given later in STORE\&GO deliverable 5.9c. With all costs combined (investment, operational and feedstock costs), the methane production costs in a PtG plant can be calculated and compared with natural gas prices to assess the poten- tial of the technology. The methane production costs of PtG plants were calculated to be 1.95 {\texteuro}/kg for full time production of the plant and these costs can be roughly divided into 43\% electricity costs, 37\% CAPEX, 13\% OPEX and 7\% costs for CO2. Operating the plant only during hours with low electricity prices was found not to improve the overall business case of the plant due to the higher burden of the CAPEX and OPEX on the produced methane. Costs for water were found to be negligible in all cases (adding a maximum of 0.3\% to the total costs). Comparing the production costs of methane from PtG plants to the current costs of natural gas (roughly 0.30 {\texteuro}/kg) it is clear that PtG cannot compete with fossil gas today. We illustrate the effect of a decrease by half of the electrolyser investment costs -- the most expensive component of the PtG plant in terms of investment costs -- and find that production costs of methane decrease from 1.95 {\texteuro}/kg to 1.63 {\texteuro}/kg. Although this is a significant cost reduction (16\%) it is -- by far -- not suffi- cient to bridge the gap to the price of natural gas. Many things can change in the (near) future that would improve the business case of PtG. A further decrease in the electrolyser investment costs is possible, just as a decrease in costs of other plant components. The electricity prices could also change: a reduction in the average price but also a different pattern with more hours with low prices would be beneficial for PtG. It is important to re- mark, however, that the electricity prices used in the calculations in this report are already the low- est prices that have been observed in recent years (Germany 2016) and that further reductions might be feasible in the short-run but not in the long-run. The revenue of the produced gas ultimately defines whether the PtG plant can operate economi- cally or not. The methane has to compete with natural gas, but the revenues could be higher due to the green character of the gas, as opposed to the fossil nature of natural gas. The market per- spective of green gases is a topic that will be further investigated in deliverable 8.5d.},

  abstract = {A significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will be necessary in the coming decades to enable the global community to avoid the most dangerous consequences of man-made global warming. This fact is reflected in Germany's 7th Federal Energy Research Program (EFP), which was adopted in 2018. Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies used to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere comprise one way to achieve these reductions in greenhouse gases. DAC has been identified as a technology (group) for which there are still major technology gaps. The intention of this article is to explore the potential role of DAC for the EFP by using a multi-dimensional analysis showing the technology's possible contributions to the German government's energy and climate policy goals and to German industry's global reputation in the field of modern energy technologies, as well as the possibilities of integrating DAC into the existing energy system. The results show that the future role of DAC is affected by a variety of uncertainty factors. The technology is still in an early stage of development and has yet to prove its large-scale technical feasibility, as well as its economic viability. The results of the multi-dimensional evaluation, as well as the need for further technological development, integrated assessment, and systems-level analyses, justify the inclusion of DAC technology in national energy research programs like the EFP.},

Practitioners generally make use of LCI databases for such data, and the ecoinvent database is the largest transparent unit-process LCI database worldwide. Since its first release in 2003, it has been continuously updated, and version 3 was published in 2013. The release of version 3 introduced several significant methodological and technological improvements, besides a large number of new and updated datasets. The aim was to expand the content of the database, set the foundation for a truly global database, support regionalized LCIA, offer multiple system models, allow for easier integration of data from different regions, and reduce maintenance efforts. This article describes the methodological developments.},

Included in this analysis are the capital cost, operation and maintenance, and electrical generation cost for synthesizing jet fuel at sea using either ocean thermal energy conversion or nuclear power processes as the energy source. The results suggest that jet fuel could be produced at sea for \$3 to \$6/gal. Comparing these costs with current and historical prices of fuel purchased by the Department of Defense provides insight into the economic and operational benefits of a sea-based fuel synthesis process for the Navy.},
