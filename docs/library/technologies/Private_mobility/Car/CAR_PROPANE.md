# Car Propane

## Car Definition

The **Car** category is defined as a vehicle featuring four wheels and
two axles, with a primary function of transporting passengers within
private transportation settings.

### Car Performance and Usage Metrics[^1]

The performance and usage metrics for cars are as follows:

- **Annual Distance (*d~annual~*):** Cars on
  average cover a distance of 14,602 km per year.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n~lpv~*):** The average
  occupancy rate for cars is determined to be 1.57 passengers per
  vehicle.
- **Utilization Factor:** The utilization factor for cars is
  established at 5%, correlating to an average daily use of 1 hour and
  15 minutes.
- **Reference Capacity:** This leads to a reference capacity of 52.34
  passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h), calculated using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where *c*~*p*~ denotes the capacity utilization percentage.

## Propane

An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a type of heat engine where fuel
combustion takes place inside a chamber. This causes an increase in
temperature and pressure. This pressure is then applied directly to
pistons, rotors or a nozzle, which converts the thermal energy of
combustion into mechanical energy to move the vehicle. Propane-powered
vehicles operate like gasoline-powered ones. There are two types of
propane fuel injection system: vapor injection and liquid injection. In
both cases, propane is stored as a liquid in a tank at relatively low
pressure. Liquid injection technology enables more precise control of
fuel delivery, improving engine performance and efficiency.
