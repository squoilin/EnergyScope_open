# Direct Air Capture LT

## Introduction

Low Temperature Direct air capture (DAC) is a process of capturing
carbon dioxide (CO~2~) directly from the ambient air (as opposed to
capturing from point sources, such as a Cement Prod. factory or
biomass power plant) and generating a concentrated stream of CO~2~ for
sequestration or utilization. The air flows through a filter where CO~2~
is removed. DAC_LT is not an alternative to traditional, point-source
carbon capture and storage (CCS), but can be used to manage emissions
from distributed sources, like exhaust fumes from cars.

DAC would require a carbon-free electricity source. According to
Ranjan et al., the use of any fossil-fuel-generated electricity would
end up releasing more CO~2~ to the atmosphere than it would capture.

Different from DAC which depend only on electricity input, the DAC_LT
depends only on heat supply.
