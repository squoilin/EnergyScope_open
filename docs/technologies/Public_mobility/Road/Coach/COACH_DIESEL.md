# Coach Diesel

## Intercity Coach Bus Description

The **Intercity Coach Bus** is designed for high-capacity, long-distance
passenger transportation, providing a crucial link between cities with a
focus on comfort and efficiency.

### Intercity Coach Bus Performance Metrics

- **Capacity:** It is equipped to carry 15 or more passengers.
- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** The coach
  operates over an impressive annual distance of 140,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** With an
  average occupancy of 40 passengers per vehicle.
- **Capacity Factor:** Assuming a 20% capacity utilization.
- **Reference Capacity:** Consequently, a reference capacity of
  3,196.35 passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h) is calculated.

The reference capacity is computed using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This calculation takes into account the annual distance covered, the
average number of passengers, and the capacity utilization factor to
provide a clear picture of the Intercity Coach Bus’s performance and
contribution to public transport infrastructure.

## Diesel

An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a type of heat engine where fuel
combustion takes place inside a chamber. This causes an increase in
temperature and pressure. This pressure is then applied directly to
pistons, rotors or a nozzle, which converts the thermal energy of
combustion into mechanical energy to move the vehicle. However, this
combustion generates numerous substances with potential impacts on human
health and the environment, including :

- Carbon Dioxide (CO~2~): a GHG contributing to climate change and ocean
  acidification.

- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx): precursors to the formation of photochemical
  ozone (smog), which promotes respiratory problems, and causes, among
  other things, the acidification of terrestrial and aquatic
  environments and the eutrophication of the marine environment.

- Particle Matter (PM): potentially causing respiratory problems when
  inhaled.

- Carbon Monoxide (CO): considered toxic to humans and animals.

Diesel engines, which also run on biodiesel and synthetic fuels, do not
require spark plugs but rely on fuel vapour compression to trigger
combustion.

Diesel fuel has an LHV of 11.83 \[kWh/kg\], making it a common choice
for heavy-duty transportation due to its high energy density and
efficiency.
