# SUV CNG

## SUV Class Definition

The **Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) class** is a versatile category
encompassing four-wheeled, two-axle vehicles, originally designed for
cargo transportation but now primarily used for passenger mobility.

### SUV Technology Model

The SUV technology model encompasses light trucks, including:

- Pickup trucks
- Sport utility vehicles (SUVs)
- Minivans
- Vans
- Special purpose vehicles

These are modeled within the context of passenger transportation.

### Performance Metrics[^1]

The SUV class is characterized by specific annual performance metrics
and usage parameters:

- **Annual Distance (*d~annual~*):** The average
  distance covered annually by an SUV is 16,462 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n~lpv~*):** The mean
  number of passengers per vehicle is calculated to be 1.7.
- **Utilization Factor:** Set at 5%, this reflects an average daily
  use of 1 hour and 15 minutes per day.
- **Reference Capacity:** Calculated at 63.89 passenger-kilometers per
  hour (pkm/h), this metric is derived from the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where *c*~*p*~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.

## CNG

Natural gas can be used in modified internal combustion engines.
Compressed natural gas does, however, require more storage space than
gasoline and diesel, since it is a gas rather than a liquid. A tank to
store natural gas generally requires extra space in the trunk of the car
or on the bed of the van. This space issue can, however, be resolved
during construction, by installing the tank under the bodywork.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), primarily methane stored at high pressure,
has an LHV of 35.8 \[MJ/m3\] and a density of 0.777 \[kg/m3\].
