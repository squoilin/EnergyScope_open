# Train Freight Natural Gas

## Overview

Natural Gas Train Freight involves the transportation of goods by trains powered by natural gas, either in the form of
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). Utilizing natural gas as a fuel source offers a cleaner
alternative to diesel, reducing emissions and operational costs while maintaining efficiency.

## Historical Context[^1]

- **1980s and 1990s Initiatives**: American railroads began exploring LNG as a fuel in the 1980s and 1990s. Burlington
  Northern worked with Energy Conversion, Inc. from 1988 to 1996, converting EMD SD-40-2 locomotives for LNG use. These
  locomotives operated in the Powder River Basin coal service from 1991 to 1996.
- **Union Pacific's Efforts**: Union Pacific sponsored the development and testing of LNG locomotives by GE and EMD
  between 1992 and 1998, although these locomotives never entered service.
- **BNSF and CN Demonstrations**: BNSF continues to use LNG-powered switch locomotives, and Canadian National (CN)
  initiated an LNG demonstration program in 2012 using EMD SD40-2 locomotives and a 30,000-gallon LNG tender.

## Process Description

- **Natural Gas Supply**: Natural gas is stored onboard the train in either compressed (CNG) or liquefied (LNG) form.
- **Engine Operation**: The train is equipped with natural gas engines or dual-fuel engines that can operate on both
  natural gas and diesel. These engines convert the chemical energy of natural gas into mechanical energy to drive the
  train.
- **Refueling**: Natural gas refueling stations are used to refill the trainâ€™s storage tanks, similar to conventional
  fuel stations but equipped for CNG or LNG.

## Benefits

- **Reduced Emissions**: Natural gas combustion produces lower levels of CO~2~, NOx, and particulate matter compared to
  diesel, resulting in a cleaner alternative.
- **Cost-Effective**: Natural gas is generally cheaper than diesel, leading to reduced fuel costs and operational
  savings.
- **Abundant Supply**: Natural gas is widely available and has a well-established distribution network.
- **Energy Density**: LNG, in particular, has a high energy density, allowing for longer range capabilities compared to
  other alternative fuels.

## Challenges

- **Infrastructure Development**: Requires investment in CNG or LNG refueling infrastructure, which can be costly and
  logistically complex.
- **Engine Adaptation**: Existing diesel engines need to be modified or replaced with natural gas-compatible engines,
  involving significant upfront costs.
- **Fuel Storage**: Onboard storage of CNG and LNG requires specialized, insulated tanks to maintain fuel quality and
  safety.
- **Methane Emissions**: Natural gas is primarily methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and any leakage during production,
  transport, or use can offset some of the environmental benefits.

## Capital Intensive Considerations

- **High Initial Investment**: Locomotives and supporting infrastructure, such as fueling depots and maintenance
  facilities, require significant capital investment. A locomotive can cost over $2 million, and the infrastructure for
  LNG fueling must handle large volumes quickly and safely.
- **Fuel Tenders**: Special-purpose cars are needed to carry the LNG. These tenders are complex and must meet rigorous
  safety standards due to the risks associated with LNG.
- **Long-Term Asset Life**: Locomotives have an asset life of over 20 years, making them a long-term investment. This
  necessitates careful consideration of infrastructure changes and their long-term benefits.

## Testing and Safety

- **Extensive Testing**: Just as diesel locomotives underwent extensive testing from the 1930s to the 1950s, LNG systems
  are currently in a similar phase. Canadian National (CN) and the Association of American Railroads (AAR) are
  developing standards and conducting field tests.
- **Safety Regulations**: The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and industry groups are working to ensure that LNG
  fuel systems meet stringent safety standards, addressing numerous potential failure modes.

## Future Outlook

The adoption of natural gas train freight is expected to grow as rail operators seek to reduce emissions and fuel costs.
Advances in engine technology and the expansion of natural gas refueling infrastructure will facilitate this transition.
Additionally, integrating renewable natural gas (RNG) produced from organic waste could further enhance the
environmental benefits, making natural gas train freight a key component in the shift towards more sustainable rail
transportation.
