# Industrial Wood Cogeneration

## Introduction

Cogeneration refers to the simultaneous generation of two useful
products instead of only one. It consists of the use of a power station
to generate electricity and heat at the same time, and is, in this case,
called combined heat and power (CHP). An Industrial Wood
Cogeneration plant uses wood as input fuel of the hot chamber to
generate steam in order to produce electricity and heat. The thermal
efficiency is 0.53 while the electrical efficiency is 0.18.
