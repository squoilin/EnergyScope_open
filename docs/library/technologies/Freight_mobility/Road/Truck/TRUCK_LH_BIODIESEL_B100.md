# Truck BioDiesel LH

## Medium-Duty Truck - Long Haul Overview

The **Medium-Duty Truck - Long Haul** category includes single-unit
vehicles with more than four tires, designed for substantial range
capabilities exceeding 320 km. These trucks play a pivotal role in
nationwide logistics, capable of handling significant cargo loads over
long distances.

### Medium-Duty Truck Performance Metrics

- **Operational Range:** Designed for long-haul operations, these
  trucks have a range of over 320 km.
- **Annual Mileage (*d~annual~*):** They record
  an annual mileage of 37,000 km, demonstrating their reliability and
  endurance in logistics operations.
- **Average Load (*n~lpv~*):** With an average load
  capacity of 3.27 tonnes per vehicle, they are integral to the
  transportation of substantial goods across the country.
- **Capacity Factor:** Based on a 10% capacity utilization factor, as
  cited by Schnidrig[^1], this reflects the operational efficiency
  considering loading times and route distances.
- **Reference Capacity:** The calculated reference capacity of 138.12
  tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h) underscores their strategic
  importance in logistics and distribution networks.

The reference capacity is computed utilizing the formula:

$$
ref_{capacity} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This calculation takes into account the annual mileage, average load
capacity, and the capacity utilization factor, highlighting the
efficiency and utility of Medium-Duty Trucks in long-haul logistics.

## B100 Biodiesel

B100 Biodiesel fuel is a diesel alternative derived entirely from
biomass. It runs on 100% biodiesel, contributing to carbon emissions
reductions in comparison to fossil fuels. Only blends of biodiesel and
petroleum diesel containing 7% vol. or less of biodiesel can be used in
diesel engines without modification. Pure biodiesel (B100) requires
engine modifications to avoid maintenance and performance problems.

### Model Remarks:

The model treats vehicles that use biodiesel and those that use
traditional diesel as equivalent in technical aspects. It is worth
noting that in the current version of QC EnergyScope, biodiesel is
treated the same as diesel and will require modification in a future
version.
