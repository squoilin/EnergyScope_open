# Methanation by Sabatier Reaction

## Introduction

Methanation is a thermochemical process of storing energy in a gaseous
fuel chemical form: synthetic natural gas (SNG/CH~4~). This
process is called Power-to-methane because it uses hydrogen produced
from an electrolyzer working with electricity. Hydrogen is combined with
carbon dioxide or with biogas, and the resulting mixture is converted
into methane in methanation reactors, based on chemical methanation
(Sabatier reaction).

The Sabatier reaction produces methane and water at
elevated temperatures (300 Â°C) and pressures (30 bar). The
resulting gas needs to be purified from impurities such as water and
unconverted hydrogen to comply with the grid specifications. The main
benefits of SNG is that it can be stored in, and transported through,
the existing natural gas grid. CH~4~ has also a higher volumetric energy
density
