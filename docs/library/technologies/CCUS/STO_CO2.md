# Usage of Stored CO~2~

## Introduction

Instead of a waste, CO~2~ could be used as raw materials for fuel
production and chemical synthesis. It could be furthemore used as
working fluids in district heating supply. SES adopts the model that
Suciu developed.

This is the reverted technology of [CO~2~ Storage](CO2_STO.md), it transforms stored CO~2~ into capture CO~2~

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the CO~2~ Storage are listed in the table
below.

```python exec="on"
