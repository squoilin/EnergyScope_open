# Tidal

## Overview

Tidal power is a form of renewable energy harnessed from the natural rise and fall of ocean tides. This energy source
leverages the gravitational interactions between the Earth, moon, and sun to generate electricity, offering a
predictable and sustainable power supply.

## Process Description

1. **Tidal Range Systems**: Utilize the difference in water height between high and low tides. Structures like barrages
   or tidal lagoons are built to capture and release water, driving turbines to generate electricity.
    - **Barrage Systems**: A dam-like structure with turbines that generate power as water flows in and out with the
      tides.
    - **Tidal Lagoons**: Man-made enclosures that harness tidal energy through controlled water flow and turbines.
2. **Tidal Stream Systems**: Capture kinetic energy from moving water using underwater turbines or similar devices.
   These systems are placed in areas with strong tidal currents.
    - **Tidal Turbines**: Similar to underwater wind turbines, these devices convert the kinetic energy of flowing water
      into electricity.

## Benefits

- **Predictability**: Tidal movements are highly predictable, providing a reliable energy source.
- **Renewable**: Utilizes the natural and perpetual movement of tides, ensuring long-term sustainability.
- **Low Carbon Emissions**: Produces electricity with minimal greenhouse gas emissions.

## Applications

- **Electricity Generation**: Tidal energy is primarily used to produce electricity for grid distribution.
- **Hybrid Energy Systems**: Can be integrated with other renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to enhance
  grid stability.

## Challenges

- **Environmental Impact**: Potential impacts on marine ecosystems, sediment transport, and coastal erosion need to be
  managed.
- **High Initial Costs**: Significant capital investment required for infrastructure development.
- **Geographical Limitations**: Effective utilization depends on suitable coastal locations with high tidal ranges or
  strong tidal currents.

## Future Outlook

Advancements in turbine technology, materials, and environmental impact mitigation are expected to drive the growth of
tidal energy. With continued investment and innovation, tidal energy has the potential to become a significant
contributor to the global renewable energy mix, providing clean and reliable power.
