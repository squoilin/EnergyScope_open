Welcome to the EnergyScope library! This guide will help you set up and start using EnergyScope, whether you’re a beginner looking to run simulations or an expert aiming to modify the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

1. Install AMPL 
EnergyScope relies on AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) for optimization modeling. AMPL must be installed first and be accessible from your system’s PATH.
   - See the [Installing AMPL section]() below for detailed instructions.

2. Python
   - Version: Python 3.6 or higher.
   - Environment: We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Choose Your Path

### Option A: Quick Start for Beginners 😎

If you’re new to EnergyScope and want a quick setup without delving into the source code:
1.	Install EnergyScope via pip:
	```
	pip install energyscope
	```
2. Run the Basic Tutorial:
Get started by following our [Basic Run Tutorial](../tutorials/basic-run.ipynb) to familiarize yourself with EnergyScope.

### Option B: Editable Installation for Experts 🏄

If you plan to modify the source code or the underlying AMPL models:
1.	Clone the EnergyScope Repository:
	```
	git clone git@gitlab.com:energyscope/energyscope.git
	```
2. Install EnergyScope in Editable Mode:
Navigate to the cloned repository and install package in editable mode:
	```
	cd energyscope
	pip install -e .
	```
	Alternatively, if you’re working within a Jupyter notebook or an interactive environment, you can use:
	```
	# Clone the repository
	!git clone git@gitlab.com:energyscope/energyscope.git
	
	# Install the package in editable mode
	%pip install -e ./energyscope
	
	# Add the package to the Python path (if necessary)
	import sys
	sys.path.append('./energyscope')
	```
3. Modify and Run Code:
You’re now ready to explore and modify the source code and AMPL models according to your needs.

## Installing AMPL

EnergyScope uses AMPL for optimization modeling. Follow these steps to install AMPL on your system:

1. Download AMPL
   - Visit the [AMPL Community Edition](https://ampl.com/ce/) page to download the appropriate version for your operating system.
2. Install AMPL
   - **Windows**:
     - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - **Linux and macOS**:
     - Extract the downloaded archive to a directory where you have read and write permissions (e.g., your home directory).
3. Activate Your License
   - AMPL Community Edition requires a free license.
   - During installation, you’ll receive a license UUID.
   - Activate your license by running the following command in the AMPL command prompt:
   ```
   shell "amplkey activate --uuid <license-uuid>";
   ```
   Replace `<license-uuid>` with your actual license UUID.
   - Note: Restart AMPL after activation to start using the new license.
4. Add AMPL to PATH
   - Windows:
     - Add the AMPL installation directory (e.g., `C:\AMPL`) to your system’s PATH environment variable.
   - Linux and macOS:
     - Open your terminal and add the following line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile:
   ```
   export PATH="/path/to/ampl:$PATH"
   ```
   - Replace /path/to/ampl with the actual path to your AMPL directory.
5. Verify AMPL Installation
To confirm that AMPL is correctly installed:
   - Open Command Prompt or Terminal:
     - Open a new command prompt (Windows) or terminal window (Linux/macOS).
   - Run AMPL:
   ```
   ampl
   ```
    - If installed correctly, you should see the `ampl:` prompt you can quit with the command 
   ```
   quit;
   ```
