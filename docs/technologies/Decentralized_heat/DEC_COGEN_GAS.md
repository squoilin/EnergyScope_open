# Decentralized Gas Cogeneration

## Introduction

Cogeneration refers to the simultaneous generation of two useful
products instead of only one. It consists of the use of a power station
to generate electricity and heat at the same time, and is, in this case, called combined heat and power (CHP).

A Decentralized Gas Cogeneration is based on a thermal power plant using natural gas as
input fuel of the hot chamber to generate steam in order to produce
electricity and heat. The thermal efficiency is 0.46 while the
electrical efficiency is 0.44.
