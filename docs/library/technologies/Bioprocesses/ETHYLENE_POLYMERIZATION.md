# Ethylene Polymerization to LD Polyethylene

## Introduction

Low density polyethylene is a thermoplastic made from the ethylene
monomer. This process employs the free radical polymerization method
where a polymer is formed by the addition of radical initiators.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the Ethylene Polym. are listed in the
table below.
