EnergyScope aims to build an active community of users from various backgrounds, including beginners (students), researchers, and case study generators. The goal is to provide an EnergyScope version that caters to the specific needs of different groups. Depending on your background and needs, there are multiple ways to contribute:

- **Beginners and Students**: These users can start by exploring the code, using EnergyScope for their projects, and identifying areas of improvement in the documentation or user experience. Contributions such as improving documentation, reporting issues, or proposing small enhancements are greatly valued.
  
- **Researchers and Experts**: Researchers and experts have full access to the raw code and can develop new modeling frameworks as part of their research or projects. Contributions in the form of advanced code modifications, new modules, or innovative algorithms are encouraged. You are invited to integrate your models, frameworks, or algorithms into the main EnergyScope repository, ensuring they are available for the wider community.

- **Case Study Generators**: Users who focus on applying EnergyScope to specific contexts can contribute by creating detailed case studies that illustrate the application of the model to real-world energy systems. These case studies can be shared with the community to provide benchmarks, encourage new applications, and promote the use of the tool in practical scenarios.

Additionally, an annual symposium is organized where researchers and developers present their breakthroughs. The symposium serves as a platform for discussing innovations and determining how they can be integrated into the EnergyScope model. Innovations can lead to the development of:

1. **New Case Studies**: Based on the breakthroughs presented, new case studies can be defined and developed.  
2. **New Modules**: If the innovation involves a significant methodological change, it can be transformed into a standalone module within the EnergyScope framework.  
3. **New Functions**: If the innovation enhances or introduces a new feature, it can be integrated as a new function or enhancement in the main framework.

## Contributing to the Code

Researchers and advanced users are encouraged to contribute new features or modules to the EnergyScope codebase. Depending on the scope of your contribution, this could include:

- **New modeling frameworks**: Extend EnergyScope’s modeling capabilities by developing and sharing new frameworks.  
- **Modules**: Add modules to enhance the functionality of EnergyScope, such as energy storage models or advanced dispatch algorithms.  
- **Functions**: Contribute individual functions or optimizations to improve specific aspects of the model.

If you would like to contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the [EnergyScope GitHub repository](https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope).  
2. **Develop your contribution**: Implement your changes in the forked repository.  
3. **Create a pull request**: Submit your changes through a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). The maintenance team will review your submission and provide feedback.

Be sure to adhere to the guidelines outlined in the repository, ensuring that your contribution aligns with the community's needs and EnergyScope's goals.

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter issues or have ideas for improvements, reporting them can be an important contribution. To report an issue, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the [Issues section](https://github.com/energyscope/EnergyScope/issues) of the repository.  
2. Click the green "New Issue" button.  
3. Choose the appropriate issue template or provide details about the problem or suggestion.  
4. Submit the issue.  


## EnergyScope Community

### About the community

The EnergyScope Community is a collaborative platform designed to bring together a diverse group of individuals including students, researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers, all of whom share a common interest in energy system modeling and sustainable energy transitions. By fostering open communication and collaboration, the community aims to accelerate the development and application of the EnergyScope tool, a comprehensive energy system modeling framework.

One of the core goals of the community is to support users of varying expertise levels. Beginners and students are encouraged to engage with the platform by exploring the model, improving documentation, and reporting issues they encounter. Researchers and experts, on the other hand, are invited to contribute more advanced developments such as new modeling frameworks, modules, or algorithms. The community also places a strong emphasis on case study contributions, which demonstrate how EnergyScope can be applied to real-world energy systems.

### Communication

To facilitate collaboration, the EnergyScope Community provides access to a [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/energyscopecommunity/shared_invite/zt-235qev7qb-Gx1Jpr3BucKjN1Ny5LlusQ), where members can interact, seek assistance, and exchange ideas. This communication platform ensures that users remain connected and informed about the latest developments, events, and opportunities for collaboration.

### Annual Symposium

The EnergyScope Community also hosts an annual symposium, a key event designed to bring together contributors from academia, industry, and policymaking to present and discuss breakthroughs in energy system modeling. The symposium offers a platform for knowledge exchange, networking, and collaboration, with a focus on integrating societal and technical innovations into energy transition models. Over the course of two or more days, participants engage in discussions and workshops aimed at driving future research directions, identifying key synergies, and exploring actionable strategies to address global energy challenges. 

The event is a key moment for defining the next steps in EnergyScope's development, such as:

- **New Case Studies**: Applying EnergyScope to new contexts and regions.  
- **New Modules**: Integrating advanced modeling techniques or specific technologies.  
- **New Functions**: Enhancing existing features or adding new ones based on the latest research.  

By attending and contributing to the symposium, participants help shape the future direction of the EnergyScope project.

Remember, your contributions—whether through code, documentation, case studies, or issue reporting—play a crucial role in the development and improvement of EnergyScope. Everyone is encouraged to contribute in a way that aligns with their expertise and interests.
