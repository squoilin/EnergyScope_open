# Car Fuel Cell H~2~

## Car Definition

The **Car** category is defined as a vehicle featuring four wheels and
two axles, with a primary function of transporting passengers within
private transportation settings.

### Car Performance and Usage Metrics[^1]

The performance and usage metrics for cars are as follows:

- **Annual Distance (*d~annual~*):** Cars on
  average cover a distance of 14,602 km per year.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n~lpv~*):** The average
  occupancy rate for cars is determined to be 1.57 passengers per
  vehicle.
- **Utilization Factor:** The utilization factor for cars is
  established at 5%, correlating to an average daily use of 1 hour and
  15 minutes.
- **Reference Capacity:** This leads to a reference capacity of 52.34
  passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h), calculated using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where *c*~*p*~ denotes the capacity utilization percentage.

## Hydrogen Fuel Cell

A hydrogen fuel cell operates by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms to
form water, releasing energy in the process. This energy can be
converted into electricity and heat. One type of hydrogen fuel cell,
known as a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) cell, uses a solid polymer
membrane that allows protons to pass through, while blocking electrons.
The membrane is coated with catalysts to accelerate the reaction.
Hydrogen molecules are fed to the anode, where they dissociate into
protons and electrons. The protons pass through the membrane to the
cathode, while the electrons circulate in an external circuit,
generating a voltage. At the cathode, oxygen molecules react with
protons and electrons to form water vapor, which is released from the
fuel cell. Overall, the operation of a hydrogen fuel cell relies on the
chemical affinity between hydrogen and oxygen, with the PEM cells being
one specific type of fuel cell.
