# Methatesis of Propylene to Ethylene

## Introduction

The methathesis (olefin disproportionation) production of ethylene is a
chemical reaction to turn propylene into ethylene and butylene. This
disproportionation reaction uses molybdena-alumina catalyst and is
affected by temperature and residence time.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the Metathesis Propylene are listed in the
table below.
