# H~2~ CCGT

## Overview

Hydrogen Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (H~2~ CCGT) is an advanced power generation technology that combines the high
efficiency of a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) system with the use of hydrogen as a clean fuel. This technology aims
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while providing reliable and efficient electricity generation. However, it is
important to note that the current primary source of hydrogen is often grey hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas
with associated CO~2~ emissions.

## Process Description

1. **Hydrogen Combustion**: Hydrogen gas (H~2~) is combusted in a gas turbine, producing high-temperature, high-pressure
   gases.
2. **Gas Turbine Operation**: The expanding gases drive the gas turbine, generating electricity in the process.
3. **Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG)**: Exhaust gases from the gas turbine pass through a heat recovery steam
   generator, producing steam.
4. **Steam Turbine Operation**: The steam produced is used to drive a steam turbine, generating additional electricity.
5. **Combined Cycle Efficiency**: The integration of gas and steam turbines enhances overall efficiency by utilizing the
   waste heat from the gas turbine to generate more power.

## Benefits

- **High Efficiency**: Combined cycle configuration provides higher efficiency compared to simple cycle gas turbines.
- **Reduced Emissions**: Hydrogen combustion produces water as the main byproduct, resulting in lower greenhouse gas
  emissions compared to fossil fuels.
- **Fuel Flexibility**: Can potentially operate on a blend of hydrogen and natural gas during the transition to full
  hydrogen usage.

## Applications

- **Utility Power Generation**: Used in large-scale power plants to provide reliable and efficient electricity to the
  grid.
- **Industrial Power**: Suitable for industrial facilities requiring both electricity and process steam.
- **Renewable Integration**: Can complement renewable energy sources by providing flexible and dispatchable power.

## Challenges

- **Hydrogen Source and Emissions**: The primary source of hydrogen is often grey hydrogen, which has associated CO~2~
  emissions. To maximize environmental benefits, a transition to green hydrogen (produced from renewable energy) is
  necessary.
- **Lower Efficiency Compared to Fuel Cells**: Combustion-based systems are generally less efficient than hydrogen fuel
  cells, which directly convert chemical energy into electricity.
- **Cost**: High costs associated with hydrogen production and the adaptation of gas turbines for hydrogen use.
- **Technological Adaptation**: Modifications needed to handle hydrogen's unique combustion properties and material
  compatibility.

## Future Outlook

With ongoing advancements in hydrogen production technologies, such as electrolysis using renewable energy, and
improvements in gas turbine designs, H~2~ CCGT systems are expected to become more economically viable. Despite current
reliance on grey hydrogen, efforts to transition to green hydrogen will enhance the environmental benefits of this
technology. H~2~ CCGT systems hold significant potential for achieving deep decarbonization in the power generation
sector, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.
