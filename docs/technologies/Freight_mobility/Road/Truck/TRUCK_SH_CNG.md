# Truck CNG SH

## Medium-Duty Truck - Short Haul Overview

The **Medium-Duty Truck for Short-Haul** operations represents a class
of robust vehicles engineered for transporting substantial loads over
moderate distances. These trucks are single units with more than four
tires, designed with a maximum range of up to 320 km, making them ideal
for regional distribution tasks.

### Medium-Duty Truck Short-Haul Performance Metrics

- **Operational Range:** Capable of covering distances up to 320 km,
  tailored for short-haul logistics.
- **Annual Mileage (*d~annual~*):** The truck
  class maintains a yearly operational distance of 26,600 km.
- **Load Capacity (*n~lpv~*):** With an average load
  capacity of 0.98 tonnes per vehicle.
- **Capacity Factor:** A 10% capacity utilization factor is applied,
  as detailed by Schnidrig[^1].
- **Reference Capacity:** Achieving a reference capacity of 29.76
  tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h), these trucks are optimally
  configured for regional distribution networks.

The formula used to calculate the reference capacity is as follows:

$$
ref_{capacity} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot 0.10}
$$

This equation considers the annual distance covered, the average load
capacity, and the capacity utilization rate, emphasizing the trucks’
utility and efficiency in short-haul transportation tasks.

## CNG

Natural gas can be used in modified internal combustion engines.
Compressed natural gas does, however, require more storage space than
gasoline and diesel, since it is a gas rather than a liquid. A tank to
store natural gas generally requires extra space in the trunk of the car
or on the bed of the van. This space issue can, however, be resolved
during construction, by installing the tank under the bodywork.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), primarily methane stored at high pressure,
has an LHV of 35.8 \[MJ/m3\] and a density of 0.777 \[kg/m3\].
