# Decentralized Thermal Heat Pump

## Introduction

An absorption heat pump is driven by a heat source, instead of
electricity in a compressor as in mechanical heat pumps. The thermal
energy is delivered by fuel combustion or steam, and the refrigerant is
a mixture (refrigerant and absorption medium). The considered fuel here
is natural gas.
