# Truck BioDiesel SH

## Medium-Duty Truck - Short Haul Overview

The **Medium-Duty Truck for Short-Haul** operations represents a class
of robust vehicles engineered for transporting substantial loads over
moderate distances. These trucks are single units with more than four
tires, designed with a maximum range of up to 320 km, making them ideal
for regional distribution tasks.

### Medium-Duty Truck Short-Haul Performance Metrics

- **Operational Range:** Capable of covering distances up to 320 km,
  tailored for short-haul logistics.
- **Annual Mileage (*d~annual~*):** The truck
  class maintains a yearly operational distance of 26,600 km.
- **Load Capacity (*n~lpv~*):** With an average load
  capacity of 0.98 tonnes per vehicle.
- **Capacity Factor:** A 10% capacity utilization factor is applied,
  as detailed by Schnidrig[^1].
- **Reference Capacity:** Achieving a reference capacity of 29.76
  tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h), these trucks are optimally
  configured for regional distribution networks.

The formula used to calculate the reference capacity is as follows:

$$
ref_{capacity} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot 0.10}
$$

This equation considers the annual distance covered, the average load
capacity, and the capacity utilization rate, emphasizing the trucks’
utility and efficiency in short-haul transportation tasks.

## B100 Biodiesel

B100 Biodiesel fuel is a diesel alternative derived entirely from
biomass. It runs on 100% biodiesel, contributing to carbon emissions
reductions in comparison to fossil fuels. Only blends of biodiesel and
petroleum diesel containing 7% vol. or less of biodiesel can be used in
diesel engines without modification. Pure biodiesel (B100) requires
engine modifications to avoid maintenance and performance problems.

### Model Remarks:

The model treats vehicles that use biodiesel and those that use
traditional diesel as equivalent in technical aspects. It is worth
noting that in the current version of QC EnergyScope, biodiesel is
treated the same as diesel and will require modification in a future
version.
