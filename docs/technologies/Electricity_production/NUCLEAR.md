# Nuclear

## Introduction

Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions that release nuclear
energy to generate heat, which is then used and converted into
electricity in nuclear power plants. The given investment cost refers to
Pressurized Water Reactors. PWR use two different loops: one loop of
light water is used to cool down the nuclear reactor and heat up a
second light water loop, in which steam will be raised and used to
generate power in the steam turbines. The dismantling costs are also
included in the investment cost.

## Quebec

Situated on the south bank of the St. Lawrence River in Bécancour,
Quebec, approximately 15 km east of Trois-Rivières, the Gentilly-2
Facilities are owned and managed by Hydro-Québec. The Gentilly-2 CANDU
reactor ceased operations permanently on December 28, 2012, and by
September 3, 2013, had been fully defueled. By December 2014, it had
transitioned to a state of safe storage, with its spent fuel either
placed in wet storage pools or encased in CANSTOR modules for dry
storage. By December 2020, the relocation of all spent fuel into dry
storage CANSTOR modules was accomplished.[^1]
