# Decentralized Advanced Cogen with H~2~

## Introduction

The LT DEC advanced cogeneration with H~2~ is based on the production of
heat and electricity thanks to the fuel cell technology. A fuel cell is
an electrochemical cell where air and a given fuel (NG, H~2~, biogas) are the inputs.

Fuel cell works with an electrochemical conversion where the
oxygen from air extracts electrons from the fuel across a conducting
membrane. Fuel cells cogenerate heat and electricity with a thermal
efficiency of 0.22 and an electrical efficiency of 0.58.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the DEC Cogen H~2~ are listed in the table
below.
