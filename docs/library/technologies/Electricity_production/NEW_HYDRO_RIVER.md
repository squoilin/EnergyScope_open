# New Hydro River

## Introduction

Hydro power stations can be classified in two main categories: hydro
run-of-Hydro River and hydro dam. The main difference between both is
whether water can be stored and released in periods of high electricity
demand. Hydro run-of-Hydro River is a non dispatchable energy source
and it is operated as baseload for power production.

This technology is employed to evaluate new developments in hydroelectricity, excluding consideration of the existing
heritage dams.

Refer to [Hydro River](HYDRO_RIVER.md) for more information.
