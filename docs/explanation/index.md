     The Explanation documentation is under construction

The **Explanation** section provides an in-depth exploration of the EnergyScope library, designed to assist users in understanding its core concepts, methodologies, and practical applications. The structure of this section is as follows:

1. [About EnergyScope](./introduction.md): An overview of the role of energy system modeling in the transition to renewable energy and how EnergyScope addresses the limitations of traditional models.  
2. [Conceptual Foundations](./conceptual_foundations.md): Covers essential concepts such as energy carriers, demand sectors, and conversion technologies. Introduces the model's approach to energy balance using optimization techniques, including the selection and use of Typical Days for temporal resolution.  
3. [Model Formulation and Implementation](./model_formulation/index.md): Describes how EnergyScope is formulated as a linear programming problem, detailing the pre-processing of data, model optimization process, and the modular design that allows customization for diverse analyses.  
4. [Contribution](./contribution.md) The Contributions section outlines how users from diverse backgrounds, such as students, researchers, and industry professionals, can engage with the EnergyScope community. It details various ways to contribute, including improving documentation, developing new modules, creating case studies, and participating in the annual symposium to drive the project's future direction.

<!-- 4. [Applications and Scenario Analysis](./applications_scenarios.md) Presents case studies and practical examples illustrating how to apply the model for national energy planning, renewable integration, and policy impact assessments. Explains how to use scenario analysis for strategic decision-making.  -->
