# HYDRO_STORAGE

## Introduction

Pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) is a technology for storing energy in
the form of potential energy of water (gravitational). Water is pumped
from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation (storage/charge
mode) when there is low-cost and off-peak electric power. It is then
released to the lower elevation reservoir (discharge mode) during
periods of high electric demand to produce electric power through
turbines.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the Hydro Storage are listed in the table
below.
