# Decentralized Oil Cogeneration

## Introduction

Cogeneration refers to the simultaneous generation of two useful
products instead of only one. It consists of the use of a power station
to generate electricity and heat at the same time, and is, in this case, called combined heat and power (CHP).

A Decentralized Wood
Cogeneration is based on a thermal power plant using wood as
input fuel of the hot chamber to generate steam in order to produce
electricity and heat.
