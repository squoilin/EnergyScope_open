# Bus Propane

## Bus Technology Overview

The **Bus** technology category encompasses city buses designed
specifically for urban transportation.

### Bus Performance and Usage Metrics

The key performance and usage metrics for buses are outlined as follows:

- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** City buses
  have an annual mileage of 56,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** The average
  occupancy rate is 14 passengers per vehicle, as reported by STM.
- **Utilization Factor:** The utilization factor is established at
  35%, resulting of an average speed of 18 (km/h) [^1].
- **Reference Capacity:** This yields a reference capacity of 63.89
  passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h), determined using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.

## Propane

An internal combustion engine (ICE) is a type of heat engine where fuel
combustion takes place inside a chamber. This causes an increase in
temperature and pressure. This pressure is then applied directly to
pistons, rotors or a nozzle, which converts the thermal energy of
combustion into mechanical energy to move the vehicle. Propane-powered
vehicles operate like gasoline-powered ones. There are two types of
propane fuel injection system: vapor injection and liquid injection. In
both cases, propane is stored as a liquid in a tank at relatively low
pressure. Liquid injection technology enables more precise control of
fuel delivery, improving engine performance and efficiency.
