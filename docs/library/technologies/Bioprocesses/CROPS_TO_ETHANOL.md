# Crops To Ethanol

## Introduction

Crops to ethanol are biochemical processes that are used to take
advantage of starch and sugar rich based plants to produce bioethanol
for transport fuel and chemical applications. Corn stover crops follows
a serie of treatments to produce bioethanol: conditioning, enzymatic
hydrolysis and fermentation, distillation, dehydration and solids
separation. The fermentation process is considered anaerobic because it
uses the O~2~ of glucose and not from air to produce ethanol and CO~2~. The
practical yield for bioethanol is: 0.5L of ethanol from 1 kg of glucose
leading to 70% efficiency. Finally, the purification of ethanol from the
fermentation process is done by distillation columns and CO~2~ scrubbers.
