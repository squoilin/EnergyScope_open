# Car Hybrid Gasoline

## Car Definition

The **Car** category is defined as a vehicle featuring four wheels and
two axles, with a primary function of transporting passengers within
private transportation settings.

### Car Performance and Usage Metrics[^1]

The performance and usage metrics for cars are as follows:

- **Annual Distance (*d~annual~*):** Cars on
  average cover a distance of 14,602 km per year.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n~lpv~*):** The average
  occupancy rate for cars is determined to be 1.57 passengers per
  vehicle.
- **Utilization Factor:** The utilization factor for cars is
  established at 5%, correlating to an average daily use of 1 hour and
  15 minutes.
- **Reference Capacity:** This leads to a reference capacity of 52.34
  passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h), calculated using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where *c*~*p*~ denotes the capacity utilization percentage.

## Hybrid Gasoline

A hybrid vehicle integrates an internal combustion engine with an
electric motor. Unlike plug-in hybrids, this type of vehicle relies on a
battery and an electric motor to capture kinetic energy during vehicle
operation.

The hybrid vehicle features a lithium battery that is smaller compared
to those found in fully electric vehicles, aimed at decreasing fuel
consumption. However, the increased weight of hybrid vehicles may lead
to higher fuel use.
