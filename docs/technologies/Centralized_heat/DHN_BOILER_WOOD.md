# DHN Wood Boiler

## Introduction

District heating is a system for distributing heat from a centralized
source to consumers via a network of underground insulated pipes
carrying hot water. Centralized heat generation avoids the need for
individual boilers or electric heaters in every building. The DHN Wood
Boiler technology uses a centralized Boiler to heat up water with Wood
as input fuel. The thermal efficiency of the Boiler is 0.864.
