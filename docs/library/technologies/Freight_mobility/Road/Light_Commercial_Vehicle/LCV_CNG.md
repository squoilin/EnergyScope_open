# LCV CNG

## Light Commercial Vehicle Class Overview

The **Light Commercial Vehicle** class encompasses four-wheeled,
two-axle vehicles, primarily designed for goods transportation. These
vehicles are notable for their adaptability to a range of cargo needs,
demonstrating versatility in the light-duty commercial sector.

### Light Commercial Vehicle Performance Metrics

- **Operational Distance (*d~annual~*):** On an
  annual basis, these vehicles are capable of covering a distance of
  38,600 km.
- **Average Cargo Weight (*n~lpv~*):** They support an
  average cargo weight of 0.19 tonnes per vehicle, accommodating the
  transportation needs of various goods.
- **Capacity Factor:** A 10% capacity utilization factor is applied to
  account for frequent stops and loading times, which are
  characteristic of their operational environment.
- **Reference Efficiency:** This results in a reference efficiency of
  8.37 tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h), underlining their essential
  role in fulfilling light-duty commercial transportation tasks.

The reference efficiency is calculated as follows:

$$
ref_{efficiency} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This formula reflects the annual operational distance, the average cargo
weight, and the capacity utilization factor, offering a clear
perspective on the efficiency and utility of Light Commercial Vehicles
in commercial transportation.

## CNG

Natural gas can be used in modified internal combustion engines.
Compressed natural gas does, however, require more storage space than
gasoline and diesel, since it is a gas rather than a liquid. A tank to
store natural gas generally requires extra space in the trunk of the car
or on the bed of the van. This space issue can, however, be resolved
during construction, by installing the tank under the bodywork.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), primarily methane stored at high pressure,
has an LHV of 35.8 \[MJ/m3\] and a density of 0.777 \[kg/m3\].
