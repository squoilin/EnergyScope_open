# School Bus CNG

## School Bus Overview

The **School Bus** is engineered to transport 15 or more passengers,
serving primarily in the conveyance of students to and from educational
institutions.

### School Bus Performance Metrics

- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** The school
  bus covers an annual distance of 24,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** It boasts an
  average loading capacity accommodating 47 passengers per vehicle.
- **Utilization Window:** The vehicle is utilized for 5.26 hours per
  day, translating to a 22% capacity utilization, according to the
  study by Duran and Walkowicz[^1].
- **Reference Capacity:** The reference capacity, derived from these
  parameters, is calculated to be 585.31 passenger-kilometers per hour
  (pkm/h), utilizing the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
Where the denominator reflects the total hours in a year multiplied by
the capacity utilization factor.

## CNG

Natural gas can be used in modified internal combustion engines.
Compressed natural gas does, however, require more storage space than
gasoline and diesel, since it is a gas rather than a liquid. A tank to
store natural gas generally requires extra space in the trunk of the car
or on the bed of the van. This space issue can, however, be resolved
during construction, by installing the tank under the bodywork.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), primarily methane stored at high pressure,
has an LHV of 35.8 \[MJ/m3\] and a density of 0.777 \[kg/m3\].
