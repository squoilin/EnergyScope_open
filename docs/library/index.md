# EnergyScope Python Library

This section provides a **learning-oriented guide** to the Python library that interfaces with the EnergyScope model. It includes hands-on tutorials and code examples to help you understand, modify, and extend the model in a programmatic way.

The tutorials are provided as Jupyter notebooks and cover essential tasks such as running the model, choosing datasets, running multiple scenarios, analyzing uncertainty, and adding custom technologies.
