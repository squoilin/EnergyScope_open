# SUV Plug-in Hybrid Gasoline

## SUV Class Definition

The **Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) class** is a versatile category
encompassing four-wheeled, two-axle vehicles, originally designed for
cargo transportation but now primarily used for passenger mobility.

### SUV Technology Model

The SUV technology model encompasses light trucks, including:

- Pickup trucks
- Sport utility vehicles (SUVs)
- Minivans
- Vans
- Special purpose vehicles

These are modeled within the context of passenger transportation.

### Performance Metrics[^1]

The SUV class is characterized by specific annual performance metrics
and usage parameters:

- **Annual Distance (*d~annual~*):** The average
  distance covered annually by an SUV is 16,462 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n~lpv~*):** The mean
  number of passengers per vehicle is calculated to be 1.7.
- **Utilization Factor:** Set at 5%, this reflects an average daily
  use of 1 hour and 15 minutes per day.
- **Reference Capacity:** Calculated at 63.89 passenger-kilometers per
  hour (pkm/h), this metric is derived from the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where *c*~*p*~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.

## Plug-in Hybrid Gasoline

Plug-In Hybrid Gasoline vehicles (PHEVs) feature both a gasoline engine
and an electric motor, with a battery that can be recharged by plugging
in. These vehicles allow for short all-electric drives and longer hybrid
trips. In such a vehicle, the lithium battery included in the vehicle is
smaller than in a 100% battery-electric vehicle.
