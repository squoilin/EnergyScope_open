# Anaerobic Digestion with CO~2~ separation

## Introduction

Anaerobic digestion is a biochemical process that is used to break the
biogenic carbon of wet biomass and release it in the form of biogas, a
gaseous mixture of CH~4~ and CO~2~. Digestion of wet
biomass under anaerobic conditions is realized with the aid of suitable
bacteria and proceeds through a complex series of (bio-)chemical
reactions that can be grouped in four main stages, namely hydrolysis,
acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. A set of parameters
including the temperature and pH are decisive for the efficient
operation of anaerobic digestion. In particular, three types of bacteria
are used depending on the temperature of operation: thermophilic (45-55
°C), mesophilic (25-45 °C) and cryophilic (below
25 °C). The production of methane is directly linked with the
type of the employed bacteria and is positively affected by temperature;
a direct compromise between methane production and energetic demands to
sustain the operating temperature to levels above room temperature.
Anaerobic digestion results also to a liquid by-product stream, the
digestate, which contains all undigested biomass as well as the valuable
nutrients originally in the feed stream. Due to the latter, digestate
streams are mostly used nowadays as soil fertilizers. However, the high
carbon content of this residual stream leaves room for additional
retrieval in the form of fuels by hydrothermal treatment. The energy
efficiency of anaerobic digestion greatly depends on both the nature of
the digested biomass as well as the operating conditions. Together, they
define the methane potential for each case (i.e. the produced volume of
methane per mass unit of digestible matter). As the energetic content of
methane is the only source of contained energy in the output biogas
stream, the methane potential is a crucial parameter to define the
energy efficiency of the process.
