# DHN Wood Cogeneration

## Introduction

District heating is a system for distributing heat from a centralized
source to consumers via a network of underground insulated pipes
carrying hot water. Centralized heat generation avoids the need for
individual boilers or electric heaters in every building. Cogeneration
refers to the simultaneous generation of two useful products instead of
only one. It consists of the use of a power station to generate
electricity and heat at the same time, and is, in this case, called
combined heat and power (CHP). A DHN Wood Cogeneration is based
on a thermal power plant using wood as input fuel of the hot chamber to
generate steam in order to produce electricity and heat. The thermal
efficiency is 0.53 while the electrical efficiency is 0.18.
