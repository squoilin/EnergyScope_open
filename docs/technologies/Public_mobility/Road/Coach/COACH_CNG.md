# Coach CNG

## Intercity Coach Bus Description

The **Intercity Coach Bus** is designed for high-capacity, long-distance
passenger transportation, providing a crucial link between cities with a
focus on comfort and efficiency.

### Intercity Coach Bus Performance Metrics

- **Capacity:** It is equipped to carry 15 or more passengers.
- **Annual Distance (d~annual~):** The coach
  operates over an impressive annual distance of 140,000 km.
- **Average Occupancy Rate (*n*~*l**p**v*~):** With an
  average occupancy of 40 passengers per vehicle.
- **Capacity Factor:** Assuming a 20% capacity utilization.
- **Reference Capacity:** Consequently, a reference capacity of
  3,196.35 passenger-kilometers per hour (pkm/h) is calculated.

The reference capacity is computed using the formula:

$$
ref_{size} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This calculation takes into account the annual distance covered, the
average number of passengers, and the capacity utilization factor to
provide a clear picture of the Intercity Coach Busâ€™s performance and
contribution to public transport infrastructure.

## CNG

Natural gas can be used in modified internal combustion engines.
Compressed natural gas does, however, require more storage space than
gasoline and diesel, since it is a gas rather than a liquid. A tank to
store natural gas generally requires extra space in the trunk of the car
or on the bed of the van. This space issue can, however, be resolved
during construction, by installing the tank under the bodywork.

Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), primarily methane stored at high pressure,
has an LHV of 35.8 \[MJ/m3\] and a density of 0.777 \[kg/m3\].
