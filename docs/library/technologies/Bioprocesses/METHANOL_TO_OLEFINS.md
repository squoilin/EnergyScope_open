# Methanol to olefins: Propylene and Ethylene

## Introduction

The Methanol to olefins process is a chemical reaction to produce
propylene and ethylene. The methanol stream is mixed with a catalyst in
a fluidized bed reactor. Then, the product is upgraded by removing the
water content. Finally, ethylene and propylene are separated thanks to a
fractionation process.
