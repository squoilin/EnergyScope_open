# AMPL reference

This documentation provides a structured reference for the EnergyDSCope AMPL model. It is divided into three main sections:

- **Sets:** Defines the fundamental indices (e.g., time periods, sectors, end-uses, resources, and technologies) that form the basic structure of the model.
- **Parameters:** Presents the input data and model attributes (e.g., demand values, costs, availability, efficiencies, and emission factors) that are used within the model equations.
- **Variables:** Describes the model decision variables that are optimized (e.g., installed capacities, operation levels, costs, and shares).

Each section includes descriptions, domains, default values, bounds, units, and relevant relationships to support clarity and ease of navigation.
