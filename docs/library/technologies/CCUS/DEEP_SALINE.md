# Deep Saline Formation

## Introduction

Saline aquifers are geological formations consisting of water permeable
rocks. Carbon sequestration into deep Deep Saline aquifers has the
largest identified storage potential. However, the capital expenditures
are higher with respect to the other types of storage because of the
infrastructures that need to be constructed.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the Deep Saline are listed in the table
below.
