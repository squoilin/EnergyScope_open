# LCV Hydrogen FC

## Light Commercial Vehicle Class Overview

The **Light Commercial Vehicle** class encompasses four-wheeled,
two-axle vehicles, primarily designed for goods transportation. These
vehicles are notable for their adaptability to a range of cargo needs,
demonstrating versatility in the light-duty commercial sector.

### Light Commercial Vehicle Performance Metrics

- **Operational Distance (*d~annual~*):** On an
  annual basis, these vehicles are capable of covering a distance of
  38,600 km.
- **Average Cargo Weight (*n~lpv~*):** They support an
  average cargo weight of 0.19 tonnes per vehicle, accommodating the
  transportation needs of various goods.
- **Capacity Factor:** A 10% capacity utilization factor is applied to
  account for frequent stops and loading times, which are
  characteristic of their operational environment.
- **Reference Efficiency:** This results in a reference efficiency of
  8.37 tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h), underlining their essential
  role in fulfilling light-duty commercial transportation tasks.

The reference efficiency is calculated as follows:

$$
ref_{efficiency} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv}}{8760 \cdot c_p}
$$

Where c~p~ represents the capacity utilization percentage.
This formula reflects the annual operational distance, the average cargo
weight, and the capacity utilization factor, offering a clear
perspective on the efficiency and utility of Light Commercial Vehicles
in commercial transportation.

## Hydrogen Fuel Cell

A hydrogen fuel cell operates by combining hydrogen and oxygen atoms to
form water, releasing energy in the process. This energy can be
converted into electricity and heat. One type of hydrogen fuel cell,
known as a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) cell, uses a solid polymer
membrane that allows protons to pass through, while blocking electrons.
The membrane is coated with catalysts to accelerate the reaction.
Hydrogen molecules are fed to the anode, where they dissociate into
protons and electrons. The protons pass through the membrane to the
cathode, while the electrons circulate in an external circuit,
generating a voltage. At the cathode, oxygen molecules react with
protons and electrons to form water vapor, which is released from the
fuel cell. Overall, the operation of a hydrogen fuel cell relies on the
chemical affinity between hydrogen and oxygen, with the PEM cells being
one specific type of fuel cell.
