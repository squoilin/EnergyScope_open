    **Prerequisites:**

    - AMPL must be installed first and be accessible from your system‚Äôs PATH.
    - Python 3.6 or higher is required.

    **Installation Paths:**

    - **Option A:** Quick Start for Beginners üòé
        - Install EnergyScope via `pip`.
        - Ideal for users who want a simple setup without modifying the source code.
    - **Option B:** Editable Installation for Experts üèÑ
        - Clone the EnergyScope repository and install in editable mode.
        - Suitable for users who plan to modify the source code or AMPL models.

Welcome to the EnergyScope library! This guide will help you set up and start using EnergyScope, whether you‚Äôre a beginner looking to run simulations or an expert aiming to modify the source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

1. **Install AMPL**  
    - EnergyScope relies on AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) for optimization modeling. AMPL must be installed first and be accessible from your system‚Äôs PATH.  
    - See the [Installing AMPL section](#installing-ampl) below for detailed instructions.

2. **Install Python**  
    - Version: Python 3.6 or higher.
    - Environment: We recommend using a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Choose Your Path

### Option A: Quick Start for Beginners üòé

If you‚Äôre new to EnergyScope and want a quick setup without delving into the source code:

1. **Install EnergyScope via pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install energyscope
    ```
2. **Run the Basic Tutorial:**  
   Get started by following our [Basic Run Tutorial](../tutorials/basic-run.ipynb) to familiarize yourself with EnergyScope.

### Option B: Editable Installation for Experts üèÑ

If you plan to customize the source code or the underlying AMPL models:

1. **Clone the EnergyScope Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/energyscope/energyscope.git
    ```
2. **Install EnergyScope in Editable Mode:**  
   Navigate to the cloned repository and install the package in editable mode:
    ```bash
    cd energyscope
    pip install -e .
    ```
   Alternatively, if you‚Äôre working within a Jupyter notebook or an interactive environment, you can use:
    ```python
    # Clone the repository
    !git clone git@gitlab.com:energyscope/energyscope.git

    # Install the package in editable mode
    %pip install -e ./energyscope

    # Add the package to the Python path (if necessary)
    import sys
    sys.path.append('./energyscope')
    ```
3. **Modify and Run Code:**  
   You‚Äôre now ready to explore and modify the source code and AMPL models according to your needs.

## Installing AMPL

EnergyScope uses AMPL for optimization modeling. Follow these steps to install AMPL on your system:

1. **Download AMPL**  
   Visit the [AMPL Community Edition](https://ampl.com/ce/) page to download the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. **Install AMPL**  
    - **On Windows:**  
     Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
    - **On Linux and macOS:**  
     Extract the downloaded archive to a directory where you have read and write permissions (e.g., your home directory).

3. **Activate Your License**  
   AMPL Community Edition requires a free license. During installation, you‚Äôll receive a license UUID. Activate your license by running the following command in the AMPL command prompt:
    ```bash
    shell "amplkey activate --uuid <license-uuid>";
    ```
   Replace `<license-uuid>` with your actual license UUID.  
   *Note:* Restart AMPL after activation to start using the new license.

4. **Add AMPL to PATH**  
    - **On Windows:**  
     Add the AMPL installation directory (e.g., `C:\AMPL`) to your system‚Äôs PATH environment variable.
    - **On Linux and macOS:**  
     Open your terminal and add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
    ```bash
    export PATH="/path/to/ampl:$PATH"
    ```
   Replace `/path/to/ampl` with the actual path to your AMPL directory.

5. **Verify AMPL Installation**  
   To confirm that AMPL is correctly installed:
    - Open Command Prompt or Terminal (on Windows, open a new command prompt; on Linux/macOS, open a new terminal window).
    - Run AMPL:
    ```bash
    ampl
    ```
   If installed correctly, you should see the `ampl:` prompt. You can exit by typing:
    ```bash
    quit;
    ```
