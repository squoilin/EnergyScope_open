# Ethane Cracking to Ethylene and Propylene

## Introduction

Ethane Cracking is a thermochemical process to transform ethane
(C~2~H~6~) to a mixture of hydrocarbons composed by
ethylene (C~2~H~4~) and propylene
(C~3~H~6~). Ethane hydrocarbon feed is mixed with
superheated steam and sent into a cracking furnace where the feedstock
is briefly heated to very high temperature. Hydrocarbons are broken down
to smaller and lighter olefins including ethylene and propylene. The
furnace outlet stream is subsequently fed to a water-based quench, to
prevent further reactions. Then, the stream goes to a serie of
separation column to remove byproducts such as methane and ethane to
recover high concentration of ethylene and propylene. Ethylene is the
most commonly manufactured petrochemical as it is the root
chemical for plastics and synthetic products.
