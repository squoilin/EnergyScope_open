# PEM Electrolysis

## Introduction

Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis is a cell equipped with
a proton exchange membrane to operate electrolysis of water and produce
hydrogen for energy storage. The PEM splits water into H~2~ and O~2~ on
either side of the solid polymer electrolyte membrane. H+ protons pass
through the PEM to the cathode and are reduced to hydrogen. PEM
electrolysers can reach higher efficiencies than alkaline electrolyser
and can deal with fast load changes, which can be very beneficial in
Power to Gas applications

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the PEM Electrolysis are listed in the
table below.
