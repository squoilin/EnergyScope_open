# Biogas to Biomethane Methanation

## Introduction

The methanation process from biogas to biomethane is a thermochemical
operation allowing to increase the methane yield of the biogas. Biogas
is a gaseous mixture of CH~4~ (60 vol%) and CO~2~ (40
vol%) produced by anaerobic digestion. For an unrestricted injection
into the gas grid, the carbon dioxide need to be removed in order to
obtain a methane concentration of 96 vol%. Conventionally, the carbon
dioxide is separated from mixture by amine scrubbing or gas separation
membrane. It is released into the environment as waste. Direct
methanation consist in upgrading the biogas to biomethane without prior
separation of CO~2~. The biogas enters a methanation reactor
and the carbon dioxide reacts with hydrogen coming from an electrolyser
fuelled by renewable excess electricity to produce biomethane.
