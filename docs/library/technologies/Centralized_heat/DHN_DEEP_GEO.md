# DHN Deep Geothermal

## Introduction

District heating is a system for distributing heat from a centralized
source to consumers via a network of underground insulated pipes
carrying hot water. Centralized heat generation avoids the need for
individual boilers or electric heaters in every building. This
technology considers the direct use of a Geothermal well at 4.2 km
depth for district heating application.
