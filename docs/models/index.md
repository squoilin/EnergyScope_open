# Overview

**EnergyScope** is designed with a modular architecture that allows users to adjust the level of detail and expand the model based on specific needs. While the core model provides a robust foundation for energy system optimization, several complementary modules can be activated to gain additional insights on more specialized topics. These modules enhance the modelâ€™s capabilities but may increase computational complexity and time. Below is a brief introduction to each module.


## [Temporal Resolution](module_td.md)

!!! abstract "Temporal Resolution Module"
    The **Temporal Resolution** module improves the granularity of time-based simulations, allowing for more detailed temporal modeling and better analysis of energy dynamics over different timescales.

This module allows for a finer resolution of time when simulating energy systems, moving beyond the basic annual or typical day structure to incorporate more detailed time slices. This is useful for modeling short-term dynamics such as hourly fluctuations in energy demand or supply, making it especially relevant for grids with a high share of intermittent renewables like solar and wind.

!!! info "Application"
    - Short-term grid balancing
    - Demand response strategies
    - High-resolution electricity market simulations


## Geographic Decomposition

    The **Geographic Decomposition** module enables spatial resolution, allowing users to model energy flows across different geographic regions, including cross-border energy exchanges.

This module breaks down the energy system into specific geographic regions, allowing users to model regional differences in resource availability, demand profiles, and infrastructure constraints. It can also be used to simulate energy trading between regions or countries and evaluate the impact of decentralized generation and regional grid infrastructure.

!!! info "Application"
    - National and regional energy planning  
    - Cross-border electricity trading
    - Infrastructure development analysis


## [Mobility](module_mob.md)

!!! abstract "Mobility Module"
    The **Mobility** module models energy demand from the transportation sector, focusing on the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), hydrogen transport, and biofuels into the energy system.

With the rise of electric vehicles and other alternative transport technologies, the **Mobility** module allows users to analyze the energy demand of the transportation sector. It models the adoption rates of electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cells, and biofuel usage, along with the impact on electricity demand and refueling infrastructure.

!!! info "Application"
    - Transport sector decarbonization
    - EV infrastructure planning
    - Mobility pathways
    - Vehicle-to-Grid


## [Grids & Infrastructure](module_infra.md)

!!! abstract "Grids & Infrastructure Module"
    The **Grids & Infrastructure** module focuses on modeling the development and capacity of energy infrastructure, such as electricity grids, transmission lines, and storage systems.

This module adds the capability to analyze grid infrastructure in more detail, including the capacity and expansion of transmission and distribution networks. It also considers the role of energy storage systems (e.g., batteries and pumped hydro) in balancing supply and demand, and in ensuring grid stability.

!!! info "Application"
    - Infrastructure investment planning
    - grid stability analysis
    - energy storage integration.


## [Carbon Flows](module_co2.md)

!!! abstract "Carbon Flows Module"
    The **Carbon Flows** module tracks carbon emissions throughout the energy system and can integrate carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies.

This module provides detailed insights into the flow of carbon through the energy system, from emissions generated by fossil fuel consumption to carbon sequestration through CCUS technologies. It is critical for analyzing the pathways toward achieving net-zero emissions targets and evaluating the feasibility of carbon mitigation strategies.

!!! info "Application"
    - Carbon emissions reduction strategies
    - CCUS integration,
    - net-zero energy system planning


## [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](module_lca.md)

!!! abstract "LCA Module"
    The **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** module allows users to assess the full environmental impacts of technologies and energy flows, from raw material extraction to end-of-life.

This module extends the system boundary to include the full life cycle of energy technologies and systems. It calculates the environmental impact of resource extraction, manufacturing, operation, and disposal, offering a comprehensive understanding of the environmental footprint beyond operational emissions.

!!! info "Application"
    - Environmental impact assessments
    - sustainable technology development
    - circular economy analysis
