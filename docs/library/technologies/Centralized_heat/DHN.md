# DHN

## Introduction

District heating is a system for distributing heat from a centralized
source to consumers via a network of underground insulated pipes
carrying hot water. Centralized heat generation avoids the need for
individual boilers or electric heaters in every building. The investment
for the installation of the district heating network is accounted here.
