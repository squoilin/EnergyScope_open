# DHN HP Elec

## Introduction

District heating is a system for distributing heat from a centralized
source to consumers via a network of underground insulated pipes
carrying hot water. Centralized heat generation avoids the need for
individual boilers or electric heaters in every building. A heat pump is
a device transferring thermal energy from a heat source into a heat
sink, absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it into a warmer
one using external power. This DHN heat pump technology considers a
constant coefficient of performance of 4.
