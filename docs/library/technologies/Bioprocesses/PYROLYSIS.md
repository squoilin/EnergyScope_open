# Pyrolysis: Wood to Diesel

## Introduction

Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process for converting biomass into a
liquid product that can be further upgraded into a transportation fuel.
It is defined as the thermal decomposition in an oxygen-free environment
by heating from approximately 250 to 650°C. It releases
volatile gases, of which a part condenses into a viscous fluid named
bio-oil, as well as solids collected as char. The biomass polymer
molecules are breaking apart into smaller stable molecules that are
typically hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, steam and carbon dioxide.
Fast pyrolysis involves the anaerobic thermochemical decomposition of
lignocellulosic biomass from 450 °C to about 650 °C and at to produce
liquids (bio-oil), solids (char and ash) and non-condensable gas (NCG).
Char and NCG can be combusted to provide the energy required to drive
biomass pyrolysis, while the combustion waste heat can be utilised for
electric power generation. Bio-oil can be upgraded into naphtha-range
transport fuels such as diesel or car gasoline via two refinery
operations: hydroprocessing and catalytic cracking.
