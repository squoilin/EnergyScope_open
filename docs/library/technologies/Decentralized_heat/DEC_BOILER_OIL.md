# Decentralized Oil Boiler

## Introduction

The LT DEC Gas Boiler technology uses light fuel oil as fuel input to
produce heat with a thermal efficiency of 0.85. The amount of heat
released by this technology depends on the heating value of the fuel
(Oil LHV = 40-45 MJ/kg), the mass flow rate and the thermal efficiency.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the DHN Boiler Oil Dec are listed in the
table below.
