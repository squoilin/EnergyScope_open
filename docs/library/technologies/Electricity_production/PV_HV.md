# PV Infrastructures

## Introduction

This technology was incorporated by Fischer (2023)[^1] to represent large PV considered on infrastructure such as
highways, parkings, stadiums...

This technology should only be used in CH EnergyScope.

## ES Model Parameters

All the parameters concerning the PV Infrastructures are listed in the table
below.

```python exec="on"
from bibdatamanagement import *

print(MdDisplay.print_md_params(bib_file_path='docs/assets/ES_Canada_3.bib',filter_entry='PV_HV'))
```

## References

```python exec="on"
from bibdatamanagement import *

print(MdDisplay.print_md_sources(bib_file_path='docs/assets/ES_Canada_3.bib', filter_entry='PV_HV'))
```
