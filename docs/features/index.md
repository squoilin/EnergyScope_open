# Overview

**EnergyScope** uses a modular architecture that balances core functionality with optional advanced features. These modules enhance analysis depth but may increase computational demands. Below is a summary of available modules.

---

## [Temporal Resolution](module_td.md)

**Improves simulation granularity**: Enables high-resolution modeling (e.g. hourly) to better capture demand/supply fluctuations â€” key for renewable-heavy grids.

**Use cases:**

- Grid balancing
- Demand response
- High-resolution market simulations

---

## Geographic Decomposition

**Adds spatial resolution**: Models regional energy dynamics and infrastructure, including cross-border flows.

**Use cases:**

- National/regional energy planning  
- Electricity trading
- Infrastructure analysis

---

## [Mobility](module_mob.md)

**Integrates transport energy demand**: Simulates EVs, hydrogen, and biofuels, analyzing their energy needs and infrastructure impact.

**Use cases:**

- Transport decarbonization
- EV infrastructure planning
- Mobility pathways (incl. V2G)

---

## [Grids & Infrastructure](module_infra.md)

**Models grid and storage systems**: Evaluates capacity, expansion, and the role of storage for grid reliability and flexibility.

**Use cases:**

- Investment planning
- Grid stability
- Storage integration

---

## [Carbon Flows](module_co2.md)

**Tracks carbon and CCUS**: Monitors emissions across the system and supports integration of capture, utilization, and storage technologies.

**Use cases:**

- Emission reduction strategies
- CCUS integration
- Net-zero pathway planning

---

## [Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)](module_lca.md)

**Assesses full environmental impacts**: Evaluates cradle-to-grave effects of technologies, including materials, operation, and end-of-life phases.

**Use cases:**

- Environmental footprint analysis
- Sustainable tech design
- Circular economy evaluation
