# Semi Methane FC SH

## Semi Trailer Truck - Short Haul Overview

The **Heavy-Duty Truck used for Short-Haul** journeys stands as a pillar
of the transport sector, specially configured to transport large volumes
of freight over relatively short distances. This category includes
tractor/semitrailer combinations with more than four tires, used for
operations within a 320 km range.

### Semi Trailer Truck Short-Haul Performance Metrics

- **Operational Range:** Used with a maximum operational range of up
  to 320 km.
- **Annual Performance (*d~annual~*):** Boasting
  an annual performance capability of 105,000 km.
- **Load Capacity (*n~lpv~*):** With a substantial
  average load capacity of 5.76 tonnes per vehicle.
- **Average Speed:** Operating at an average speed of 80 km/h,
  optimizing delivery times for short-haul logistics.
- **Capacity Factor:** A 15% capacity utilization factor is
  considered.
- **Reference Capacity:** The derived reference capacity of 460.27
  tonne-kilometers per hour (tkm/h).

The reference capacity is calculated as follows:

$$
ref_{capacity} = \dfrac{d_{annual} \cdot n_{lpv} \cdot average\\speed}{8760 \cdot 0.15}
$$

This calculation method accounts for the annual distance, average load
capacity, average speed, and the capacity utilization rate.

## Methane Fuel Cell

Methane fuel cell vehicles leverage the chemical energy of methane, CH4,
to generate electricity through a fuel cell. These vehicles operate on
the principle of converting methane directly into electrical energy,
which then powers the vehicle’s electric motor.
