# Methanol to Aromatics

## Introduction

The methanol to aromatics chemical process is a low-carbon production of
Benzene, Toluene and Xylene (BTX) using a green methanol (i.e. methanol
from green hydrogen). Methanol is converted into BTX compounds using a
zeolite catalyst at 370-540 Â°C and 20-25 bars. The CO~2~
reduction from this BTX production is based on the carbon capture needed
to produce the methanol.
